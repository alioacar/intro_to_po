    "At the simplest level, salinity is the total amount of dissolved\n",

    "salt is very small, and we must be very careful to define salinity in\n",
    "ways that are accurate and practical. To better understand the need for\n",
    "accuracy, look at {numref}`fig6_1`. Notice that the range of salinity for most\n",
    "of the ocean’s water is from 34.60 to 34.80 parts per thousand, which is\n",
    "200 parts per million. The variability in the deep North Pacific is even\n",
    "smaller, about 20 parts per million. If we want to classify water with\n",
    "different salinity, we need definitions and instruments accurate to\n",
    "about one part per million. Notice that the range of temperature is much\n",
    "larger, about 1, and temperature is easier to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a practical definition of salinity that has useful accuracy is\n",

    "since Tiros-N was launched in 1978.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrument was originally designed to measure cloud temperatures and\n",
    "hence cloud height. The instrument had, however, sufficient accuracy and\n",
    "precision that it was soon used to measure regional and global\n",
    "temperature patterns at the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrument is a radiometer that converts infrared radiation into an\n",
    "electrical voltage. It includes a mirror that scans from side to side\n",
    "across the sub-satellite track and reflects radiance from the ground\n",
    "into a telescope, a telescope that focuses the radiance on detectors,\n",
    "detectors sensitive to different wavelengths that convert the radiance\n",
    "at those wavelengths into electrical signals, and electronic circuitry\n",
    "to digitize and store the radiance values. The instruments observes a\n",
    "2700-km wide swath centered on the sub-satellite track. Each observation\n",
    "along the scan is from a pixel that is roughly one kilometer in diameter\n",
    "near the center of the scan and that increases in size with distance\n",
    "from the sub-satellite track.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radiometers measures infrared radiation emitted from the surface in\n",

    "infrared bands include radiation emitted from the sea and from water\n",
    "vapor in the air along the path from the satellite to the ground. The\n",
    "3.7 $\\mu$m band is least sensitive to water vapor and other errors, but\n",
    "it works only at night because sunlight has radiance in this band. The\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Unresolved or undetected clouds: Large, thick clouds are obvious in the\n",
    "images of water temperature Thin clouds such as low stratus and high\n",
    "cirrus produce much small errors that are difficult or almost impossible\n",
    "to detect. Clouds smaller in diameter than 1 km, such as trade-wind\n",
    "cumuli, are also difficult to detect. Special techniques have been\n",
    "developed for detecting small clouds ({numref}`fig6_12`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Water vapor, which absorbs part of the energy radiated from the sea\n",
    "surface: Water vapor reduces the apparent temperature of the sea\n",
    "surface. The influence is different in the 10.8 $\\mu$m and 12.0 $\\mu$m\n",
    "channels, allowing the difference in the two signals to be used to\n",
    "reduce the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aerosols, which absorb infrared radiation. They radiate at temperatures\n",
    "found high in the atmosphere. Stratospheric aerosols generated by\n",
    "volcanic eruptions can lower the observed temperatures by up to a few\n",

    "## Light in the Ocean and Absorption of Light\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunlight in the ocean is important for many reasons: It heats sea water,\n",
    "warming the surface layers; it provides energy required by\n",
    "phytoplankton; it is used for navigation by animals near the surface;\n",
    "and reflected subsurface light is used for mapping chlorophyll\n",
    "concentration from space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Light in the ocean travels at a velocity equal to the velocity of light\n",
    "in a vacuum divided by the index of refraction ($n$), which is typically\n",
    "$n = 1.33$. Hence the velocity in water is about $2.25 \\times 10^8$ m/s. Because light travels slower in water than in air,\n",
    "some light is reflected at the sea surface. For light shining straight\n",
    "down on the sea, the reflectivity is $(n - 1)^2 /(n + 1)^2$. For\n",
    "seawater, the reflectivity is $0.02 = 2$%. Hence most sunlight reaching\n",
    "the sea surface is transmitted into the sea, little is reflected. This\n",
    "means that sunlight incident on the ocean in the tropics is mostly\n",
    "absorbed below the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which sunlight is attenuated determines the depth which is\n",
    "lighted and heated by the sun. Attenuation is due to absorption by\n",

    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Density in the ocean is determined by temperature, salinity, and\n",
    "    pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Density changes in the ocean are very small, and studies of water\n",
    "    masses and currents require density with an accuracy of 10 parts per\n",
    "    million.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Density is not measured, it is calculated from measurements of\n",
    "    temperature, salinity, and pressure using the equation of state of\n",
    "    sea water.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Accurate calculations of density require accurate definitions of\n",
    "    temperature and salinity and an accurate equation of state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Salinity is difficult to define and to measure. To avoid the\n",
    "    difficulty, oceanographers use conductivity instead of salinity.\n",
    "    They measure conductivity and calculate density from temperature,\n",
    "    conductivity, and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  A mixed layer of constant temperature and salinity is usually found\n",
    "    in the top 1–100 meters of the ocean. The depth is determined by\n",
    "    wind speed and the flux of heat through the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  To compare temperature and density of water masses at different\n",
    "    depths in the ocean, oceanographers use potential temperature and\n",
    "    potential density which remove most of the influence of pressure on\n",
    "    density.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Water parcels below the mixed layer move along neutral surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Surface temperature of the ocean was usually measured at sea using\n",
    "    bucket or injection temperatures. Global maps of temperature combine\n",
    "    these observations with observations of infrared radiance from the\n",
    "    sea surface measured by an <span class=\"smallcaps\">avhrr</span> in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Temperature and conductivity are usually measured digitally as a\n",
    "    function of pressure using a <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span>. Before 1960–1970\n",
    "    the salinity and temperature were measured at roughly 20 depths\n",
    "    using Nansen bottles lowered on a line from a ship. The bottles\n",
    "    carried reversing thermometers which recorded temperature and depth\n",
    "    and they returned a water sample from that depth which was used to\n",
    "    determine salinity on board the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Light is rapidly absorbed in the ocean. 95% of sunlight is absorbed\n",
    "    in the upper 100 m of the clearest sea water. Sunlight rarely\n",
    "    penetrates deeper than a few meters in turbid coastal waters.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Phytoplankton change the color of sea water, and the change in color\n",
    "    can be observed from space. Water color is used to measure\n",
    "    phytoplankton concentration from space."
