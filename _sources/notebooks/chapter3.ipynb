    "# The Physical Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth is an oblate ellipsoid, an ellipse rotated about its minor axis,\n",
    "with an equatorial radius of $R_e = 6,378.1349$ km {cite:labelpar}`west1982mean` slightly\n",
    "greater than the polar radius of $R_p = 6,356.7497$ km. The small equatorial bulge is due to earth’s rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distances on earth are measured in many different units, the most common\n",
    "are degrees of latitude or longitude, meters, miles, and nautical miles.\n",
    "*Latitude* is the angle between the local vertical and the equatorial\n",
    "plane. A meridian is the intersection at earth’s surface of a plane\n",
    "perpendicular to the equatorial plane and passing through earth’s axis\n",
    "of rotation. *Longitude* is the angle between the standard meridian and\n",
    "any other meridian, where the standard meridian is the one that passes\n",
    "through a point at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England. Thus\n",
    "longitude is measured east or west of Greenwich.\n",
    "\n",
    "A degree of latitude is not the same length as a degree of longitude\n",
    "except at the equator. Latitude is measured along great circles with\n",
    "radius $R$, where $R$ is the mean radius of earth. Longitude is measured\n",
    "along circles with radius $R \\cos \\varphi$, where $\\varphi$ is latitude.\n",
    "Thus $1^{\\circ}$ latitude $= 111$ km, and $1^{\\circ}$ longitude\n",
    "$= 111 \\cos \\varphi$ km.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because distance in degrees of longitude is not constant, oceanographers\n",
    "measure distance on maps using degrees of latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nautical miles and meters are connected historically to the size of\n",
    "earth. Gabriel Mouton proposed in 1670 a decimal system of measurement\n",
    "based on the length of an arc that is one minute of a great circle of\n",
    "earth. This eventually became the nautical mile. Mouton’s decimal system\n",
    "eventually became the metric system based on a different unit of length,\n",
    "the meter, which was originally intended to be one ten-millionth the\n",
    "distance from the Equator to the pole along the Paris meridian. Although\n",
    "the tie between nautical miles, meters, and earth’s radius was soon\n",
    "abandoned because it was not practical, the approximations are very\n",
    "good. For example, earth’s polar circumference is approximately 40,008\n",
    "km. Therefore one ten-millionth of a quadrant is 1.0002 m. Similarly, a\n",
    "nautical mile should be 1.8522 km, which is very close to the official\n",
    "definition of the *international nautical mile*: 1 nm $\\equiv$ 1.8520\n",

    "absorption and $k$ is an absorption coefficient which depends on\n",

    "$I = I_0 \\exp(-kx)$ Typical values of $k$ (in decibels dB per\n",
    "kilometer) are: 0.08 dB/km at 1000 Hz, and 50 dB/km at 100,000 Hz.\n",
    "Decibels are calculated from: $dB = 10 \\log(I/I_0)$, where $I_0$ is the\n",
    "original acoustic power, $I$ is the acoustic power after absorption.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, at a range of 1 km a 1000 Hz signal is attenuated by only\n",
    "1.8%: $I = 0.982 I_0$. At a range of 1 km a 100,000 Hz signal is reduced\n",
    "to $I = 10^{-5} I_0$. The 30,000 Hz signal used by typical echo sounders\n",
    "to map the ocean’s depths are little attenuated going from the surface\n",
    "to the bottom and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very low frequency sounds in the sound channel, those with frequencies\n",
    "below 500 Hz have been detected at distances of megameters. In 1960\n",
    "15-Hz sounds from explosions set off in the sound channel off Perth\n",
    "Australia were heard in the sound channel near Bermuda, nearly halfway\n",
    "around the world. Later experiment showed that 57-Hz signals transmitted\n",

    "Bermuda in the Atlantic and at Monterey, California in the Pacific {cite:labelpar}`munk1994heard`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use of Sound\n",
    "\n",
    "Because low frequency sound can be heard at great distances, the US\n",
    "Navy, in the 1950s, placed arrays of microphones on the sea floor in\n",
    "deep and shallow water and connected them to shore stations. The Sound\n",
    "Surveillance System <span class=\"small\">SOSUS</span>, although designed to track\n",
    "submarines, has found many other uses. It has been used to listen to and\n",
    "track whales up to 1,700 km away, and to find the location of sub-sea\n",
    "volcanic eruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the ocean were scaled down to a width of 8 inches it would have\n",
    "    depths about the same as the thickness of a piece of paper. As a\n",
    "    result, the velocity field in the ocean is nearly 2-dimensional.\n",
    "    Vertical velocities are much smaller than horizontal velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  There are only three official ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The volume of ocean water exceeds the capacity of the ocean basins,\n",
    "    and the ocean overflows on to the continents creating continental\n",
    "    shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The depths of the ocean are mapped by echo sounders which measure\n",
    "    the time required for a sound pulse to travel from the surface to\n",
    "    the bottom and back. Depths measured by ship-based echo sounders\n",
    "    have been used to produce maps of the sea floor. The maps have poor\n",
    "    horizontal resolution in some regions because the regions were\n",
    "    seldom visited by ships and ship tracks are far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  The depths of the ocean are also measured by satellite altimeter\n",
    "    systems which profile the shape of the sea surface. The local shape\n",
    "    of the surface is influenced by changes in gravity due to sub-sea\n",
    "    features. Recent maps based on satellite altimeter measurements of\n",
    "    the shape of the sea surface combined with ship data have depth\n",
    "    accuracy of $\\pm$100 m and horizontal resolutions\n",
    "    of $\\pm$3 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Typical sound speed in the ocean is 1480 m/s. Speed depends\n",
    "    primarily on temperature, less on pressure, and very little on\n",
    "    salinity. The variability of sound speed as a function of pressure\n",
    "    and temperature produces a horizontal sound channel in the ocean.\n",
    "    Sound in the channel can travel great distances. Low-frequency\n",
    "    sounds below 500 Hz can travel halfway around the world provided the\n",
    "    path is not interrupted by land."
