    "# Coastal Processes and Tides\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter I described waves on the sea surface. Now we can\n",
    "consider several special and important cases: the transformation of\n",
    "waves as they come ashore and break; the currents and edge waves\n",
    "generated by the interaction of waves with coasts; tsunamis; storm\n",
    "surges; and tides, especially tides along coasts and in the deep ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shoaling Waves and Coastal Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave phase and group velocities are a function of depth when the depth\n",
    "is less than about one-quarter wavelength in deep water. Wave period and\n",
    "frequency are invariant (don’t change as the wave comes ashore); and\n",
    "this is used to compute the properties of shoaling waves. Wave height\n",
    "increases as wave group velocity slows. Wave length decreases. Waves\n",
    "change direction due to refraction. Finally, waves break if the water is\n",
    "sufficiently shallow; and broken waves pour water into the surf zone,\n",
    "creating long-shore and rip currents.\n",

    "The dispersion relation (16.3) is used to calculate wave properties as\n",
    "the waves propagate from deep water offshore to shallow water just\n",
    "outside the surf zone. Because $\\omega$ is constant, (16.3) leads to:\n",

    "extending seaward from a headland (figure 17.2). Wave group velocity is\n",
    "faster in the deeper water between the ridges, and the wave crests\n",
    "become progressively deformed as the wave propagates toward the beach.\n",
    "Wave energy, which propagates perpendicular to wave crests, is refracted\n",
    "out of the region between the headland. As a result, wave energy is\n",
    "focused into the headlands, and breakers there are much larger than\n",
    "breakers in the bay. The difference in wave height can be surprisingly\n",
    "large. On a calm day, breakers can be knee high shoreward of a submarine\n",

    "##### Breaking Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "As waves move into shallow water, the group velocity becomes small, wave\n",
    "energy per square meter of sea surface increases, and non-linear terms\n",
    "in the wave equations become important. These processes cause waves to\n",
    "steepen, with short steep crests and broad shallow troughs. When wave\n",
    "slope at the crest becomes sufficiently steep, the wave breaks (figure\n",
    "17.3 Right). The shape of the breaking wave depends on the slope of the\n",
    "bottom, and the steepness of waves offshore (figure 17.3 Left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steep waves tend to lose energy slowly as the waves moves into shallower\n",
    "water through water spilling down the front of the wave. These are\n",
    "spilling breakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less steep waves on steep beaches tend to steepen so quickly that the\n",
    "crest of the wave moves much faster than the trough, and the crest,\n",
    "racing ahead of the trough, plunges into the trough (figure 17.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the beach is sufficiently steep, the wave can surge up the face of\n",
    "the beach without breaking in the sense that white water is formed. Or\n",
    "if it is formed, it is at the leading edge of the water as it surges up\n",
    "the beach. An extreme example would be a wave incident on a vertical\n",
    "breakwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 17.4 Steep, plunging\n",

    "breakers are the archetypical breaker. The edge  \n",
    "of such breakers are ideal for surfing. From photo by Jeff Devine.\n",

    "<span id=\"fig:wavecropped\" label=\"fig:wavecropped\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wave-Driven Currents\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves break in a narrow band of shallow water along the beach, the *surf\n",
    "zone*. After breaking, waves continues as a near-vertical wall of\n",
    "turbulent water called a *bore* which carries water to the beach. At\n",
    "first, the bore surges up the beach, then retreats. The water carried by\n",
    "the bore is left in the shallow waters inside the breaker zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 17.5 Sketch of rip currents\n",
    "\n",
    "generated by water carried to the beach by breaking waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:rips\" label=\"fig:rips\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Water dumped inside the breaker zone must return offshore. It does this\n",
    "by first moving parallel to the beach as an *along-shore current*. Then\n",
    "it turns and flows offshore perpendicular to the beach in a narrow,\n",
    "swift *rip current*. The rips are usually spaced hundreds of meters\n",
    "apart (figure 17.5). Usually there is a band of deeper water between the\n",
    "breaker zone and the beach, and the long-shore current runs in this\n",
    "channel. The strength of a rip current depends on the height and\n",
    "frequency of breaking waves and the strength of the onshore wind. Rips\n",
    "are a danger to unwary swimmers, especially poor swimmers bobbing along\n",
    "in the waves inside the breaker zone. They are carried along by the\n",
    "along-shore current until they are suddenly carried out to sea by the\n",
    "rip. Swimming against the rip is futile, but swimmers can escape by\n",
    "swimming parallel to the beach.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Edge waves* are produced by the variability of wave energy reaching\n",
    "shore. Waves tend to come in groups, especially when waves come from\n",
    "distant storms. For several minutes breakers may be smaller than\n",
    "average, then a few very large waves will break. The minute-to-minute\n",
    "variation in the height of breakers produces low-frequency variability\n",
    "in the along-shore current. This, in turn, drives a low-frequency wave\n",
    "attached to the beach, an edge wave. The waves have periods of a few\n",
    "minutes, a long-shore wave length of around a kilometer, and an\n",
    "amplitude that decays exponentially offshore (figure 17.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 17.6 Computer-assisted sketch of\n",

    "## Tsunamis\n",
    "\n",
    "Tsunamis are low-frequency ocean waves generated by submarine\n",
    "earthquakes. The sudden motion of sea floor over distances of a hundred\n",
    "or more kilometers generates waves with periods of 15–40 minutes\n",
    "(figure 17.7). A quick calculation shows that such waves must be\n",
    "shallow-water waves, propagating at a speed of 180 m/s and having a\n",
    "wavelength of 130 km in water 3.6 km deep (figure 17.8). The waves are\n",
    "not noticeable at sea, but after slowing on approach to the coast, and\n",
    "after refraction by sub-sea features, they can come ashore and surge to\n",
    "heights ten or more meters above sea level. In an extreme example, the\n",
    "great 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami destroyed hundreds of villages, killing\n",
    "at least 200,000 people.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first wave of a tsunami is not likely to be the biggest.\n",

    "## Storm Surges\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm winds blowing over shallow, continental shelves pile water against\n",
    "the coast. The increase in sea level is known as a storm surge. Several\n",
    "processes are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ekman transport by winds parallel to the coast transports water toward\n",
    "the coast causing a rise in sea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winds blowing toward the coast push water directly toward the coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave run-up and other wave interactions transport water toward the coast\n",
    "adding to the first two processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge waves generated by the wind travel along the coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low pressure inside the storm raises sea level by one centimeter for\n",
    "each millibar decrease in pressure through the inverted-barometer\n",
    "effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the storm surge adds to the tides, and high tides can change a\n",

    "## Theory of Ocean Tides\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides have been so important for commerce and science for so many\n",
    "thousands of years that tides have entered our everyday language: *time\n",
    "and tide wait for no one*, *the ebb and flow of events*, *a high-water\n",
    "mark*, and *turn the tide of battle*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides produce strong currents in many parts of the ocean. Tidal currents\n",
    "can have speeds of up to 5 m/s in coastal waters, impeding navigation\n",
    "and mixing coastal waters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal currents generate internal waves over seamounts, continental\n",
    "slopes, and mid-ocean ridges. The waves dissipate tidal energy. Breaking\n",
    "internal waves and tidal currents are a major force driving oceanic\n",
    "mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal mixing helps drive the deep circulation, and it influences climate\n",
    "and abrupt climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal currents can suspend bottom sediments, even in the deep ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth’s crust is elastic. It bends under the influence of the tidal\n",
    "potential. It also bends under the weight of oceanic tides. As a result,\n",
    "the sea floor, and the continents move up and down by about 10 cm in\n",
    "response to the tides. The deformation of the solid earth influence\n",
    "almost all precise geodetic measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oceanic tides lag behind the tide-generating potential. This produces\n",
    "forces that transfer angular momentum between earth and the tide\n",
    "producing body, especially the moon. As a result of tidal forces,\n",
    "earth’s rotation about it’s axis slows, increasing the length of day;\n",
    "the rotation of the moon about earth slows, causing the moon to move\n",
    "slowly away from earth; and moon’s rotation about it’s axis slows,\n",
    "causing the moon to keep the same side facing earth as the moon rotates\n",
    "about earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides influence the orbits of satellites. Accurate knowledge of tides is\n",
    "needed for computing the orbit of altimetric satellites and for\n",
    "correcting altimeter measurements of oceanic topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidal forces on other planets and stars are important for understanding\n",
    "many aspects of solar-system dynamics and even galactic dynamics. For\n",
    "example, the rotation rate of Mercury, Venus, and Io result from tidal\n",
    "forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mariners have known for at least four thousand years that tides are\n",
    "related to the phase of the moon. The exact relationship, however, is\n",
    "hidden behind many complicating factors, and some of the greatest\n",
    "scientific minds of the last four centuries worked to understand,\n",
    "calculate, and predict tides. Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, Newton, Euler,\n",
    "Bernoulli, Kant, Laplace, Airy, Lord Kelvin, Jeffreys, Munk and many\n",
    "others contributed. Some of the first computers were developed to\n",
    "compute and predict tides. Ferrel built a tide-predicting machine in\n",
    "1880 that was used by the U.S. Coast Survey to predict nineteen tidal\n",
    "constituents. In 1901, Harris extended the capacity to 37 constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all this work important questions remained: What is the\n",
    "amplitude and phase of the tides at any place on the ocean or along the\n",
    "coast? What is the speed and direction of tidal currents? What is the\n",
    "shape of the tides on the ocean? Where is tidal energy dissipated?\n",
    "Finding answers to these simple questions is difficult, and the first,\n",
    "accurate, global maps of deep-sea tides were only published in 1994\n",
    "(LeProvost et al. 1994). The problem is hard because the tides are a\n",
    "self-gravitating, near-resonant, sloshing of water in a rotating,\n",
    "elastic, ocean basin with ridges, mountains, and submarine basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting tides along coasts and at ports is much easier. Data from a\n",
    "tide gauge plus the theory of tidal forcing gives an accurate\n",
    "description of tides near the tide gauge.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidal Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides are calculated from the hydrodynamic equations for a\n",
    "self-gravitating ocean on a rotating, elastic earth. The driving force\n",
    "is the gradient of the gravity field of the moon and sun. If the earth\n",
    "were an ocean planet with no land, and if we ignore the influence of\n",
    "inertia and currents, the gravity gradient produces a pair of bulges of\n",
    "water on earth, one on the side facing the moon or sun, one on the side\n",
    "away from the moon or sun. A clear derivation of the forces is given by\n",
    "Pugh (1987) and by Dietrich, Kalle, Krauss, and Siedler (1980). Here I\n",
    "follow the discussion in Pugh (1987: §3.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many oceanographic books state that the tide is produced by\n",
    "two processes: i) the centripetal acceleration at earth’s surface as the\n",
    "earth and moon circle around a common center of mass, and ii) the\n",
    "gravitational attraction of mass on earth and the moon. However, the\n",
    "derivation of the tidal potential does not involve centripetal\n",
    "acceleration, and the concept is not used by the astronomical or\n",
    "geodetic communities.\n",

    "\n",
    "To calculate the amplitude and phase of the tide on an ocean planet, we\n",
    "begin by calculating the tide-generating potential. This is much easier\n",
    "than calculating the forces. Ignoring for now earth’s rotation, the\n",

    "(Whittaker and Watson, 1963: §15.1):\n",

    "constant force $\\gamma M/R^{2}$ parallel to OA that keeps earth in orbit\n",
    "around the center of mass of the earth-moon system. The third term\n",
    "produces the tides, assuming the higher-order terms can be ignored. The\n",

    "\n",
    "If tides in the ocean were in equilibrium with the tidal potential,\n",

    "equilibrium. The shallow-water wave which is the tide cannot move fast\n",
    "enough to keep up with sun and moon. On the equator, the tide would need\n",
    "to propagate around the world in one day. This requires a wave speed of\n",
    "around 460 m/s, which is only possible in an ocean 22 km deep. In\n",
    "addition, the continents interrupt the propagation of the wave. How to\n",
    "proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate the problem of tidal prediction into two parts. The\n",
    "first deals with the prediction of tides in ports and shallow water\n",
    "where tides can be measured by tide gauges. The second deals with the\n",
    "prediction of tides in the deep ocean where tides are measured by\n",
    "satellite altimeters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidal Prediction for Ports and Shallow Water\n",
    "\n",
    "Two methods are used to predict future tides at a tide-gauge station\n",
    "using past observations of sea level measured at the gauge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Harmonic Method* This is the traditional method, and it is still\n",
    "widely used. The method typically uses 19 years of data from a coastal\n",
    "tide gauge from which the amplitude and phase of each tidal constituent\n",
    "(the tidal harmonics) in the tide-gage record are calculated. The\n",
    "frequencies used in the analysis are specified in advance from the basic\n",
    "frequencies given in table 17.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, the technique had disadvantages compared with\n",
    "the response method described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 18.6 years of data are needed to resolve the modulation of the\n",
    "lunar tides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude accuracy of $10^{-3}$ of the largest term require that at\n",
    "least 39 frequencies be determined. Doodson found 400 frequencies were\n",
    "needed for an amplitude accuracy of $10^{-4}$ of the largest term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-tidal variability introduces large errors into the calculated\n",
    "amplitudes and phases of the weaker tidal constituents. The weaker tides\n",
    "have amplitudes smaller than variability at the same frequency due to\n",
    "other processes such as wind set up and currents near the tide gauge.\n",
    "\n",
    "At many ports, the tide is non-linear, and many more tidal constituents\n",
    "are important. For some ports, the number of frequencies is\n",
    "unmanageable. When tides propagate into very shallow water, especially\n",
    "river estuaries, they steepen and become non-linear. This generates\n",
    "harmonics of the original frequencies. In extreme cases, the incoming\n",
    "waves steepens so much the leading edge is nearly vertical, and the wave\n",
    "propagates as solitary wave. This is a *tidal bore*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Response Method* This method, developed by Munk and Cartwright\n",
    "(1966), calculates the relationship between the observed tide at some\n",
    "point and the tidal potential. The relationship is the spectral\n",
    "admittance between the major tidal constituents and the tidal potential\n",
    "at each station. The admittance is assumed to be a slowly varying\n",
    "function of frequency so that the admittance of the major constituents\n",
    "can be used for determining the response at nearby frequencies. Future\n",
    "tides are calculated by multiplying the tidal potential by the\n",
    "admittance function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique requires only a few months of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tidal potential is easily calculated, and a knowledge of the tidal\n",
    "frequencies is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The admittance is $Z(f) = G(f)/H(f)$. $G(f)$ and $H(f)$ are the Fourier\n",
    "transforms of the potential and the tide gage data, and $f$ is\n",
    "frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The admittance is inverse transformed to obtain the admittance as a\n",
    "function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique works only if the waves propagate as linear waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidal Prediction for Deep-Water\n",
    "\n",

    "*Prediction Using Hydrodynamic Theory* Purely theoretical calculations\n",
    "of tides are not very accurate, especially because the dissipation of\n",
    "tidal energy is not well known. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations\n",
    "provided insight into processes influencing ocean tides. Several\n",
    "processes must be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tides in one ocean basin perturb earth’s gravitational field, and\n",
    "the mass in the tidal bulge attracts water in other ocean basins. The\n",
    "self-gravitational attraction of the tides must be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight of the water in the tidal bulge is sufficiently great that it\n",
    "deforms the sea floor. The earth deforms as an elastic solid, and the\n",
    "deformation extends thousands of kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean basins have a natural resonance close to the tidal\n",
    "frequencies. The tidal bulge is a shallow-water wave on a rotating\n",
    "ocean, and it propagates as a high tide rotating around the edge of the\n",
    "basin. Thus the tides are a nearly resonant sloshing of water in the\n",
    "ocean basin. The actual tide heights in deep water can be higher than\n",
    "the equilibrium values noted in table 17.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides are dissipated by bottom friction especially in shallow seas, by\n",
    "the flow over seamounts and mid-ocean ridges, and by the generation of\n",
    "internal waves over seamounts and at the edges of continental shelves.\n",
    "If the tidal forcing stopped, the tides would continue sloshing in the\n",
    "ocean basins for several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the tide is a shallow-water wave everywhere, its velocity\n",
    "depends on depth. Tides propagate more slowly over mid-ocean ridges and\n",
    "shallow seas. Hence, the distance between grid points in numerical\n",
    "models must be proportional to depth with very close spacing on\n",
    "continental shelves (LeProvost et al. 1994).\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal waves generated by the tides produce a small signal at the sea\n",
    "surface near the tidal frequencies, but not phase-locked to the\n",
    "potential. The noise near the frequency of the tides causes the spectral\n",
    "cusps in the spectrum of sea-surface elevation first seen by Munk and\n",

    "##### Tidal Dissipation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tides dissipate $3.75\\pm0.08$ TW of power (Kantha, 1998), of which 3.5\n",
    "TW are dissipated in the ocean, and much smaller amounts in the\n",
    "atmosphere and solid earth. The dissipation increases the length of day\n",
    "by about 2.07 milliseconds per century, it causes the semimajor axis of\n",
    "moon’s orbit to increase by 3.86 cm/yr, and it mixes water masses in the\n",
    "ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations of dissipation from Topex/Poseidon observations of\n",
    "tides are remarkably close to estimates from lunar-laser ranging,\n",
    "astronomical observations, and ancient eclipse records. The calculations\n",
    "show that roughly two thirds of the M2 tidal energy is dissipated on\n",
    "shelves and in shallow seas, and one third is transferred to internal\n",
    "waves and dissipated in the deep ocean (Egbert and ray, 2000). 85 to 90%\n",
    "of the energy of the K1 tide is dissipated in shallow water, and only\n",
    "about 10–15% is transferred to internal waves in the deep ocean\n",
    "(LeProvost 2003, personal communication).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our knowledge of the tides is now sufficiently good that we can\n",
    "begin to use the information to study mixing in the ocean. Recent\n",
    "results show that “tides are perhaps responsible for a large portion of\n",
    "the vertical mixing in the ocean” (Jayne et al. 2004). Remember, mixing\n",
    "helps drive the abyssal circulation in the ocean as discussed in §13.2\n",
    "(Munk and Wunsch, 1998). Who would have thought that an understanding of\n",
    "the influence of the ocean on climate would require accurate knowledge\n",
    "of tides?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Waves propagating into shallow water are refracted by features of\n",
    "    the seafloor, and they eventually break on the beach. Breaking waves\n",
    "    drive near-shore currents including long-shore currents, rip\n",
    "    currents, and edge waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Storm surges are driven by strong winds in storms close to shore.\n",
    "    The amplitude of the surge is a function of wind speed, the slope of\n",
    "    the seafloor, and the propagation of the storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tides are important for navigation; they influence accurate geodetic\n",
    "    measurements; and they change the orbits and rotation of planets,\n",
    "    moons, and stars in galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tides are produced by a combination of time-varying gravitational\n",
    "    potential of the moon and sun and the centrifugal forces generated\n",
    "    as earth rotates about the common center of mass of the\n",
    "    earth-moon-sun system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tides have six fundamental frequencies. The tide is the\n",
    "    superposition of hundreds of tidal constituents, each having a\n",
    "    frequency that is the sum and difference of five fundamental\n",
    "    frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Shallow water tides are predicted using tide measurements made in\n",
    "    ports and other locations along the coast. Tidal records of just a\n",
    "    few months duration can be used to predict tides many years into the\n",
    "    future.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tides in deep water are calculated from altimetric measurements,\n",
    "    especially Topex/Poseidon measurements. As a result, deep water\n",
    "    tides are known almost everywhere with an accuracy approaching\n",
    "    $\\pm 2$ cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dissipation of tidal energy in the ocean transfers angular\n",
    "    momentum from moon to earth, causing the day to become longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tidal dissipation mixes water masses, and it is a major driver of\n",
    "    the deep, meridional-overturning circulation. Tides, abyssal\n",
    "    circulation, and climate are closely linked."
