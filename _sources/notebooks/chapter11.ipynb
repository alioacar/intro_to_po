    "# Wind Driven Ocean Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "What drives the ocean currents? At first, we might answer, the winds.\n",
    "But if we think more carefully about the question, we might not be so\n",
    "sure. We might notice, for example, that strong currents, such as the\n",
    "North Equatorial Countercurrents in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean go\n",
    "upwind. Spanish navigators in the 16th century noticed strong northward\n",
    "currents along the Florida coast that seemed to be unrelated to the\n",
    "wind. How can this happen? And, why are strong currents found offshore\n",
    "of east coasts but not offshore of west coasts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers to the questions can be found in a series of three remarkable\n",
    "papers published from 1947 to 1951. In the first, Harald Sverdrup (1947)\n",
    "showed that the circulation in the upper kilometer or so of the ocean is\n",
    "directly related to the curl of the wind stress if the Coriolis force\n",
    "varies with latitude. Henry Stommel (1948) showed that the circulation\n",
    "in oceanic gyres is asymmetric also because the Coriolis force varies\n",
    "with latitude. Finally, Walter Munk (1950) added eddy viscosity and\n",
    "calculated the circulation of the upper layers of the Pacific. Together\n",
    "the three oceanographers laid the foundations for a modern theory of\n",
    "ocean circulation.\n",

    "$u\\, \\partial{u} / \\partial{x}$ are small, and that turbulence near the\n",
    "sea surface can be described using a vertical eddy viscosity. He also\n",

    "Sverdrup assumed i) The internal flow in the ocean is geostrophic; ii)\n",

    "correct. I examined Ekman’s theory in Chapter 9, and the geostrophic\n",
    "balance in Chapter 10. We know little about the depth of no motion in\n",
    "the tropical Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions are limited to the east side of the ocean because $M_x$\n",
    "grows with $x$. The result comes from neglecting friction which would\n",
    "eventually balance the wind-driven flow. Nevertheless, Sverdrup\n",
    "solutions have been used for describing the global system of surface\n",
    "currents. The solutions are applied throughout each basin all the way to\n",
    "the western limit of the basin. There, conservation of mass is forced by\n",
    "including north-south currents confined to a thin, horizontal boundary\n",
    "layer (figure 11.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one boundary condition can be satisfied, no flow through the\n",
    "eastern boundary. More complete descriptions of the flow require more\n",
    "complete equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions do not give the vertical distribution of the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results were based on data from two cruises plus average wind data\n",
    "assuming a steady state. Later calculations by Leetmaa, McCreary, and\n",
    "Moore (1981) using more recent wind data produces solutions with\n",
    "seasonal variability that agrees well with observations provided the\n",
    "level of no motion is at 500 m. If another depth were chosen, the\n",
    "results are not as good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wunsch (1996: §2.2.3) after carefully examining the evidence for a\n",
    "Sverdrup balance in the ocean concluded we do not have sufficient\n",
    "information to test the theory. He writes\n",
    "\n",
    "> The purpose of this extended discussion has not been to disapprove the\n",
    "> validity of Sverdrup balance. Rather, it was to emphasize the gap\n",

    "##### Stream Lines, Path Lines, and the Stream Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing more about the ocean’s wind-driven circulation, we\n",
    "need to introduce the concept of stream lines and the stream function\n",
    "(see Kundu, 1990: 51 & 66).\n",
    "\n",
    "At each instant in time, we can represent a flow field by a vector\n",
    "velocity at each point in space. The instantaneous curves that are\n",
    "everywhere tangent to the direction of the vectors are called the\n",
    "*stream lines* of the flow. If the flow is unsteady, the pattern of\n",
    "stream lines change with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectory of a fluid particle, the path followed by a Lagrangian\n",
    "drifter, is called the *path line* in fluid mechanics. The path line is\n",
    "the same as the stream line for steady flow, and they are different for\n",
    "an unsteady flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify the description of two-dimensional, incompressible flows\n",
    "by using the *stream function* $\\psi$ defined by:\n",
    "$$u \\equiv \\frac{\\partial{\\psi}}{\\partial{y}}, \\qquad v \\equiv -\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{\\psi}}{\\partial{x}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The stream function is often used because it is a scalar from which the\n",
    "vector velocity field can be calculated. This leads to simpler equations\n",
    "for some flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream functions are also useful for visualizing the flow. At each\n",
    "instant, the flow is parallel to lines of constant $\\psi$. Thus if the\n",
    "flow is steady, the lines of constant stream function are the paths\n",
    "followed by water parcels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume rate of flow between any two stream lines of a steady flow is\n",
    "$d\\psi$, and the volume rate of flow between two stream lines $\\psi_1$\n",
    "and $\\psi _2$ is equal to $\\psi _1 - \\psi _2$. To see this, consider an\n",
    "arbitrary line $dx = (dx, dy)$ between two stream lines (figure 11.4).\n",
    "The volume rate of flow between the stream lines is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.4 Volume transport\n",

    "equal to the difference in their values of $\\psi$.\n",

    "scaled by $g/f$. Turning to figure 10.5, the lines of constant height\n",

    "transport is proportional to the difference in height, independent of\n",

    "$$\\Psi_{bdry} = 0, \\qquad \\left(\\frac{\\partial{\\Psi}}{\\partial{n}}\\right)_{bdry} = 0$$\n",
    "where $n$ is normal to the boundary. Munk then solved (11.18) with\n",
    "(11.20) assuming the flow was in a rectangular basin extending from $x = 0$ to $x = r$, and from $y = -s$ to $y = +s$. He further assumed that\n",
    "the wind stress was zonal and in the form: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "Munk’s solution (figure 11.6) shows the dominant features of the\n",
    "gyre-scale circulation in an ocean basin. It has a circulation similar\n",

    "## Observed Surface Circulation in the Atlantic\n",
    "\n",
    "The theories by Sverdrup, Munk, and Stommel describe an idealized flow.\n",
    "But the ocean is much more complicated. To see just how complicated the\n",
    "flow is at the surface, let’s look at a whole ocean basin, the north\n",
    "Atlantic. I have chosen this region because it is the best observed, and\n",
    "because mid-latitude processes in the Atlantic are similar to\n",
    "mid-latitude processes in the other ocean. Thus, for example, I use the\n",
    "Gulf Stream as an example of a western boundary current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with the Gulf Stream to see how our understanding of ocean\n",
    "surface currents has evolved. Of course, we can’t look at all aspects of\n",
    "theflow. You can find out much more by reading Tomczak and Godfrey\n",
    "(1994) book on*Regional Oceanography: An Introduction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### North Atlantic Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The north Atlantic is the most thoroughly studied ocean basin. There is\n",
    "an extensive body of theory to describe most aspects of the circulation,\n",
    "including flow at the surface, in the thermocline, and at depth,\n",
    "together with an extensive body of field observations. By looking at\n",
    "figures showing the circulation, we can learn more about the\n",
    "circulation, and by looking at the figures produced over the past few\n",
    "decades we can trace an ever more complete understanding of the\n",
    "circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with the traditional view of the time-averaged surface flow\n",
    "in the north Atlantic based mostly on hydrographic observations of the\n",
    "density field (figure 2.7). It is a contemporary view of the mean\n",
    "circulation of the entire ocean based on a century of more of\n",
    "observations. Because the figure includes all the ocean, perhaps it is\n",
    "overly simplified. So, let’s look then at a similar view of the mean\n",
    "circulation of just the north Atlantic (figure 11.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure shows a broad, basin-wide, mid latitude gyre as we expect\n",
    "from Sverdrup’s theory described in §11.1. In the west, a western\n",
    "boundary current, the Gulf Stream, completes the gyre. In the north a\n",
    "subpolar gyre includes the Labrador current. An equatorial current\n",
    "system and countercurrent are found at low latitudes with flow similar\n",
    "to that in the Pacific. Note, however, the strong cross equatorial flow\n",
    "in the west which flows along the northeast coast of Brazil toward the\n",

    "If we look closer at the flow in the far north Atlantic (figure 11.8) we\n",
    "see that the flow is still more complex. This figure includes much more\n",
    "detail of a region important for fisheries and commerce. Because it is\n",
    "based on an extensive base of hydrographic observations, is this\n",
    "reality? For example, if we were to drop a Lagrangian float into the\n",
    "Atlantic would it follow the streamline shown in the figure?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question, let’s look at the tracks of a 110 buoys drifting\n",
    "on the sea surface compiled by Phil Richardson (figure 11.9 top). The\n",
    "tracks give a very different view of the currents in the north Atlantic.\n",
    "It is hard to distinguish the flow from the jumble of lines, sometimes\n",
    "called spaghetti tracks. Clearly, the flow is very turbulent, especially\n",
    "in the Gulf Stream, a fast, western-boundary current. Furthermore, the\n",
    "turbulent eddies seem to have a diameter of a few degrees. This is much\n",
    "different than turbulence in the atmosphere. In the air, the large\n",
    "eddies are called storms, and storms have diameters of 10–20. Thus\n",
    "oceanic “storms” are much smaller than atmospheric storms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps we can see the mean flow if we average the drifter tracks. What\n",
    "happens when Richardson averages the tracks through\n",
    "$2^{\\circ} \\times 2^{\\circ}$ boxes? The averages (figure 11.9 bottom)\n",
    "begin to show some trends, but note that in some regions, such as east\n",
    "of the Gulf Stream, adjacent boxes have very different means, some\n",
    "having currents going in different directions. This indicates the flow\n",
    "is so variable, that the average is not stable. Forty or more\n",
    "observations do not yields a stable mean value. Overall, Richardson\n",
    "finds that the kinetic energy of the eddies is 8 to 37 times larger than\n",
    "the kinetic energy of the mean flow. Thus oceanic turbulence is very\n",
    "different than laboratory turbulence. In the lab, the mean flow is\n",
    "typically much faster than the eddies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further work by Richardson (1993) based on subsurface buoys freely\n",
    "drifting at depths between 500 and 3,500 m, shows that the current\n",
    "extends deep below the surface, and that typical eddy diameter is 80 km.\n",

    "Stream increases from 26 Sv in the Florida Strait (between Florida and\n",
    "Cuba) to 55 Sv offshore of Cape Hatteras. Later measurements showed the\n",
    "transport increases from 30 Sv in the Florida Strait to 150 Sv near 40N.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed increase, and the large transport off Hatteras, disagree\n",

    "rules out the possibility that the Sverdrup flow is larger than the\n",

    "flow seems to come primarily from the Gulf Stream itself. The flow\n",
    "between 60W and 55W is to the south. The water then flows south and\n",
    "west, and rejoins the Stream between 65W and 75W. Thus, there are two\n",

    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The theory for wind-driven, geostrophic currents was first outlined\n",
    "    in a series of papers by Sverdrup, Stommel, and Munk between 1947\n",
    "    and 1951.\n",
    "\n",
    "    They showed that realistic currents can be calculated only if the\n",
    "    Coriolis parameter varies with latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sverdrup showed that the curl of the wind stress drives a northward\n",
    "    mass transport, and that this can be used to calculate currents in\n",
    "    the ocean away from western boundary currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Stommel showed that western boundary currents are required for flow\n",
    "    to circulate around an ocean basin when the Coriolis parameter\n",
    "    varies with latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Munk showed how to combine the two solutions to calculate the\n",
    "    wind-driven geostrophic circulation in an ocean basin. In all cases,\n",
    "    the current is driven by the curl of the wind stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The observed circulation in the ocean is very turbulent. Many years\n",
    "    of observations may need to be averaged together to obtain a stable\n",
    "    map of the mean flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Gulf Stream is a region of baroclinic instability in which\n",
    "    turbulence accelerates the stream. This creates a Gulf Stream\n",
    "    recirculation. Transports in the recirculation region are much\n",
    "    larger than transports calculated from the Sverdrup-Munk theory."
