    "The tropical ocean is characterized by a thin, permanent, shallow layer\n",
    "of warm water over deeper, colder water. In this respect, the vertical\n",
    "stratification is similar to the summer stratification at higher\n",

    "The shallow thermocline has important consequences. The southeast trade\n",

    "strongest in the east. North of the equator, Ekman transport is\n",
    "northward. South of the equator it is southward. The divergence of the\n",
    "Ekman flow causes upwelling on the equator. In the west, the upwelled\n",
    "water is warm. But in the east the upwelled water is cold because the\n",

    "##### Equatorial Undercurrent: Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a few meters below the surface on the equator is a strong eastward\n",
    "flowing current, the Equatorial Undercurrent, the last major oceanic\n",
    "current to be discovered. Here’s the story:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In September 1951, aboard the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research\n",
    "> vessel long-line fishing on the equator south of Hawaii, it was\n",
    "> noticed that the subsurface gear drifted steadily to the east. The\n",
    "> next year Cromwell, in company with Montgomery and Stroup, led an\n",
    "> expedition to investigate the vertical distribution of horizontal\n",
    "> velocity at the equator. Using floating drogues at the surface and at\n",
    "> various depths, they were able to establish the presence, near the\n",
    "> equator in the central Pacific, of a strong, narrow eastward current\n",
    "> in the lower part of the surface layer and the upper part of the\n",
    "> thermocline (Cromwell, *et. al.*, 1954). A few years later the Scripps\n",
    "> *Eastropac* Expedition, under Cromwell’s leadership, found the current\n",
    "> extended toward the east nearly to the Galapagos Islands but was not\n",
    "> present between those islands and the South American continent.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The current is remarkable in that, even though comparable in transport\n",
    "> to the Florida Current, its presence was unsuspected ten years ago.\n",
    "> Even now, neither the source nor the ultimate fate of its waters has\n",
    "> been established. No theory of oceanic circulation predicted its\n",
    "> existence, and only now are such theories being modified to account\n",
    "> for the important features of its flow.—Warren S. Wooster (1960).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Equatorial Undercurrent in the Atlantic was first discovered by\n",
    "Buchanan in 1886, and in the Pacific by the Japanese Navy in the 1920s\n",
    "and 1930s (McPhaden, 1986).\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, no attention was paid to these observations. Other earlier\n",
    "> hints regarding this undercurrent were mentioned by Matthäus (1969).\n",
    "> Thus the old experience becomes even more obvious which says that\n",
    "> discoveries not attracting the attention of contemporaries simply do\n",
    "> not exist.—Dietrich et al. (1980).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob Arthur (1960) summarized the major aspects of the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface flow may be directed westward at speeds of 25–75 cm/s;\n",
    "\n",
    "Current reverses at a depth of from 20 to 40 m;\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastward undercurrent extends to a depth of 400 meters with a transport\n",
    "of as much as 30 Sv $=30 \\times 10^6$ m$^3$/s;\n",
    "\n",
    "Core of maximum eastward velocity (0.50–1.50 m/s) rises from a depth of\n",
    "100 m at 140W to 40 m at 98W, then dips down;\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercurrent appears to be symmetrical about the equator and becomes\n",
    "much thinner and weaker at 2N and 2S.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent is a ribbon with\n",
    "dimensions of $0.2 \\text{ km} \\times 300 \\text{ km} \\times 13,000 \\text{ km}$ (figure 14.4).\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Equatorial Undercurrent: Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we do not yet have a complete theory for the undercurrent, we\n",
    "do have a clear understanding of some of the more important processes at\n",
    "work in the equatorial regions. Pedlosky(1996), in his excellent chapter\n",
    "on Equatorial Dynamics of the Thermocline: The Equatorial Undercurrent,\n",
    "points out that the basic dynamical balances we have used in mid\n",
    "latitudes break down near or on the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Near the equator:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coriolis parameter becomes very small, going to zero at the equator:\n",
    "$$f=2\\Omega \\sin\\varphi = \\beta y \\approx 2\\Omega \\,\\varphi$$ where\n",
    "$\\varphi$ is latitude, $\\beta = \\partial f/\\partial y \\approx 2\\Omega/R$ near the equator, and $y=R\\,\\varphi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planetary vorticity $f$ is also small, and the advection of relative\n",
    "vorticity cannot be neglected. Thus the Sverdrup balance (11.7) must be\n",
    "modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geostrophic and vorticity balances fail when the meridional distance\n",
    "$L$ to the equator is $O\\left(\\sqrt{U/\\beta}\\right)$, where\n",
    "$\\beta = \\partial f / \\partial y$. If $U=1$ m/s, then $L=200$ km or 2 of\n",
    "latitude. Lagerloeff et al (1999), using measured currents, show that\n",
    "currents near the equator can be described by the geostrophic balance\n",
    "for $|\\varphi | > 2.2^{\\circ}$. They also show that flow closer to the\n",
    "equator can be described using a $\\beta$-plane approximation\n",
    "$f = \\beta y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geostrophic balance for *zonal* currents works so well near the\n",
    "equator because $f$ and $\\partial \\zeta/\\partial y \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\varphi \\rightarrow 0$, where $\\zeta$ is sea surface\n",
    "topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upwelled water along the equator produced by Ekman pumping is not part\n",
    "of a two-dimensional flow in a north-south, meridional plane. The flow\n",
    "is three-dimensional. Water tends to flow along the contours of constant\n",
    "density (isopycnal surfaces), close to the lines of constant temperature\n",
    "in figure 14.2. Cold water enters the undercurrent in the far west\n",
    "Pacific, and it moves eastward and upward along the equator. For\n",
    "example, the 25isotherm enters the undercurrent at a depth near 125 m in\n",
    "the western Pacific at 170E and eventually reaches the surface at 125W\n",
    "in the eastern Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meridional geostrophic balance near the equator gives the speed of\n",
    "the zonal currents, but it does not explain what drives the\n",
    "undercurrent. A very simplified theory for the undercurrent is based on\n",
    "a balance of zonal pressure gradients along the equator. Wind stress\n",
    "pushes water westward, producing the deep thermocline and warm pool in\n",
    "the west. The deepening of the thermocline causes the sea-surface\n",
    "topography $\\zeta$ to be higher in the west, assuming that flow below\n",
    "the thermocline is weak. Thus there is an eastward pressure gradient\n",
    "along the equator in the surface layers to a depth of a few hundred\n",
    "meters. The eastward pressure gradient at the surface (layer A in figure\n",
    "14.5) is balanced by the wind stress $T_x$, and\n",
    "$T_x / H = -\\partial p/\\partial x$, where H is the mixed-layer depth\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a few tens of meters in layer B, the influence of the wind stress\n",
    "is small, and the pressure gradient is unbalanced, leading to an\n",
    "accelerated flow toward the east, the equatorial undercurrent. Within\n",
    "this layer, the flow accelerates until the pressure gradient is balanced\n",
    "by frictional forces which tend to slow the current. At depths below a\n",
    "few hundred meters in layer C, the eastward pressure gradient is too\n",
    "weak to produce a current, $\\partial p / \\partial x \\approx 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 14.5 **Left:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-sectional sketch of the thermocline and sea-surface topography\n",
    "along the equator. **Right:** Eastward pressure gradient in the central\n",
    "Pacific caused by the density structure at left. <span id=\"fig:equatorsketch\" label=\"fig:equatorsketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Coriolis forces keep the equatorial undercurrent centered on the\n",
    "equator. If the flow strays northward, the Coriolis force deflects the\n",
    "current southward. The opposite occurs if the flow strays southward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Equatorial Circulation: El Niño/La Niña\n",
    "\n",
    "The trades are remarkably steady, but they do vary from month to month\n",
    "and year to year, especially in the western Pacific. One important\n",
    "source of variability are Madden-Julian waves in the atmosphere\n",
    "(McPhaden, 1999). If the trades in the west weaken or reverse, the\n",
    "air-sea system in the equatorial regions can be thrown into another\n",
    "state called El Niño. This disruption of the equatorial system in the\n",
    "Pacific is the most important cause of changing weather patterns around\n",
    "the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the modern meaning of the term El Niño denotes a disruption of\n",
    "the entire equatorial system in the Pacific, the term has been used in\n",
    "the past to describe several very different processes. This causes a lot\n",
    "of confusion. To reduce the confusion, let’s learn a little history.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A Little History\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 19th century, the term was applied to conditions off the coast of\n",
    "Peru. The following quote comes from the introduction to Philander’s\n",
    "(1990) excellent book *El Niño, La Niña, and the Southern Oscillation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the year 1891, Señor Dr. Luis Carranza of the Lima Geographical\n",
    "> Society, contributed a small article to the Bulletin of that Society,\n",
    "> calling attention to the fact that a counter-current flowing from\n",
    "> north to south had been observed between the ports of Paita and\n",
    "> Pacasmayo.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Paita sailors, who frequently navigate along the coast in small\n",
    "> craft, either to the north or the south of that port, name this\n",

    "> has been observed to appear immediately after Christmas.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As this counter-current has been noticed on different occasions, and\n",
    "> its appearance along the Peruvian coast has been concurrent with rains\n",
    "> in latitudes where it seldom if ever rains to any great extent, I\n",
    "> wish, on the present occasion, to call the attention of the\n",
    "> distinguished geographers here assembled to this phenomenon, which\n",
    "> exercises, undoubtedly, a very great influence over the climatic\n",
    "> conditions of that part of the world.—Señor Frederico Alfonso\n",
    "> Pezet’s address to the Sixth International Geographical Congress in\n",
    "> Lima, Peru 1895.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Peruvians noticed that in some years the El Niño current was\n",
    "stronger than normal, it penetrated further south, and it is associated\n",
    "with heavy rains in Peru. This occurred in 1891 when (again quoting from\n",
    "Philander’s book)\n",
    "\n",
    "> …it was then seen that, whereas nearly every summer here and there\n",
    "> there is a trace of the current along the coast, in that year it was\n",
    "> so visible, and its effects were so palpable by the fact that large\n",
    "> dead alligators and trunks of trees were borne down to Pacasmayo from\n",
    "> the north, and that the whole temperature of that portion of Peru\n",
    "> suffered such a change owing to the hot current that bathed the coast.\n",
    "> …—Señor Frederico Alfonso Pezet.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> …the sea is full of wonders, the land even more so. First of all the\n",
    "> desert becomes a garden …. The soil is soaked by the heavy downpour,\n",
    "> and within a few weeks the whole country is covered by abundant\n",
    "> pasture. The natural increase of flocks is practically doubled and\n",

    "\n",
    "The El Niño of 1957 was even more exceptional. So much so that it\n",
    "attracted the attention of meteorologists and oceanographers throughout\n",
    "the Pacific basin.\n",
    "\n",

    "> lingered six weeks beyond its appointed term—Sette and Isaacs\n",
    "> (1960).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just months after the event, in 1958, a distinguished group of\n",
    "oceanographers and meteorologists assembled in Rancho Santa Fe,\n",
    "California to try to understand the *Changing Pacific Ocean in 1957 and\n",
    "1958* (Sette and Isaacs (1960). There, for perhaps the first time, they\n",
    "began the synthesis of atmospheric and oceanic events leading to our\n",
    "present understanding of El Niño.\n",
    "\n",
    "While oceanographers had been mostly concerned with the eastern\n",
    "equatorial Pacific and El Niño, meteorologists had been mostly concerned\n",
    "with the western tropical Pacific, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the\n",
    "Southern Oscillation. Hildebrandsson, the Lockyers, and Sir Gilbert\n",
    "Walker noticed in the early decades of the 20th century that pressure\n",
    "fluctuations throughout that region are highly correlated with pressure\n",
    "fluctuations in many other regions of the world (figure 14.6). Because\n",
    "variations in pressure are associated with winds and rainfall, they\n",
    "wanted to find out if pressure in one region could be used to forecast\n",
    "weather in other regions using the correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The early studies found that the two strongest centers of the\n",
    "variability are near Darwin, Australia and Tahiti. The fluctuations at\n",
    "Darwin are opposite those at Tahiti, and resemble an oscillation.\n",
    "Furthermore, the two centers had strong correlations with pressure in\n",
    "areas far from the Pacific. Walker named the fluctuations the *Southern\n",
    "Oscillation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Southern Oscillation Index* is sea-level pressure at Tahiti minus\n",
    "sea-level pressure at Darwin (figure 14.7) normalized by the standard\n",
    "deviation of the difference. The index is related to the trade winds.\n",
    "When the index is high, the pressure gradient between east and west in\n",
    "the tropical Pacific is large, and the trade winds are strong. When the\n",
    "index is negative trades, are weak.\n",

    "been smoothed with a 5-month running mean. Strong El Niño events\n",

    "\n",
    "The connection between the Southern Oscillation and El Niño was made\n",

    "Bjerknes (1966) noticed the relationship between equatorial temperatures\n",
    "in the Pacific during the 1957 El Niño and fluctuations in the trade\n",
    "winds associated with the Southern Oscillation. The theory was further\n",
    "developed by Wyrtki (1975).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because El Niño and the Southern Oscillation are so closely related, the\n",
    "phenomenon is often referred to as the *El Niño–Southern Oscillation*\n",
    "or <span class=\"smallcaps\">enso</span>. More recently, the oscillation is referred to as\n",
    "El Niño/La Niña, where La Niña refers to the positive phase of the\n",
    "oscillation when trade winds are strong, and water temperature in the\n",
    "eastern equatorial region is very cold.\n",

    "\n",
    "Wyrtki (1975) gives a clear description of El Niño.\n",
    "\n",
    "> During the two years preceding El Niño, excessively strong southeast\n",
    "> trades are present in the central Pacific. These strong southeast\n",
    "> trades intensify the subtropical gyre of the South Pacific, strengthen\n",
    "> the South Equatorial Current, and increase the east-west slope of sea\n",
    "> level by building up water in the western equatorial Pacific. As soon\n",
    "> as the wind stress in the central Pacific relaxes, the accumulated\n",
    "> water flows eastward, probably in the form of an equatorial Kelvin\n",
    "> wave. This wave leads to the accumulation of warm water off Ecuador\n",
    "> and Peru and to a depression of the usually shallow thermocline. In\n",
    "> total, El Niño is the result of the response of the equatorial Pacific\n",
    "> to atmospheric forcing by the trade winds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the trades in the western equatorial Pacific not only weaken,\n",
    "they actually reverse direction for a few weeks to a month, producing\n",
    "*westerly wind bursts* that quickly deepen the thermocline there. The\n",
    "deepening of the thermocline launches an eastward propagating Kelvin\n",
    "wave and a westward propagating Rossby wave. (If you are asking, What\n",

    "The Kelvin wave deepens the thermocline as it moves eastward, and it\n",
    "carries warm water eastward. Both processes cause a deepening of the\n",
    "mixed layer in the eastern equatorial Pacific a few months after the\n",
    "wave is launched in the western Pacific. The deeper thermocline in the\n",
    "east leads to upwelling of warm water, and the surface temperatures\n",
    "offshore of Ecuador and Peru warms by 2–4. The warm water reduces the\n",
    "temperature contrast between east and west, further reducing the trades.\n",
    "The strong positive feedback between sea-surface temperature and the\n",

    "> A complete El Niño cycle results in a net heat discharge from the\n",

    "> normal trade winds. Consequently, the time scale of the Southern\n",

    "It is these far reaching events that make El Niño so important. Few\n",
    "people care about warm water off Peru around Christmas, many care about\n",
    "global changes the weather. El Niño is important because of its\n",
    "atmospheric influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Kelvin wave reaches the coast of Ecuador, part is reflected as\n",
    "an westward propagating Rossby wave, and part propagates north and south\n",
    "as a coastal trapped Kelvin wave carrying warm water to higher\n",
    "latitudes. For example, during the 1957 El Niño, the northward\n",
    "propagating Kelvin wave produced unusually warm water off shore of\n",
    "California, and it eventually reached Alaska. This warming of the west\n",
    "coast of North America further influences climate in North America,\n",
    "especially in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Kelvin wave moves along the coast, it forces Rossby waves which\n",
    "move west across the Pacific at a velocity that depends on the latitude\n",
    "(14.4). The velocity is very slow at high latitudes and fastest on the\n",
    "equator, where the reflected wave moves back as a deepening of the\n",
    "thermocline, reaching the central equatorial Pacific a year later.\n",
    "Similarly, the westward propagating Rossby wave launched at the start of\n",
    "the El Niño in the west, reflects off Asia and returns to the central\n",
    "equatorial Pacific as a Kelvin wave, again about a year later.\n",
    "\n",
    "El Niño ends when the Rossby waves reflected from Asia and Ecuador meet\n",
    "in the central Pacific about a year after the onset of El Niño (Picaut,\n",
    "Masia, and du Penhoat, 1997). The waves push the warm pool at the\n",
    "surface toward the west. At the same time, the Rossby wave reflected\n",
    "from the western boundary causes the thermocline in the central Pacific\n",
    "to become shallower when the waves reaches the central Pacific. Then any\n",
    "strengthening of the trades causes upwelling of cold water in the east,\n",
    "which increases the east-west temperature gradient, which increases the\n",
    "trades, which increases the upwelling (Takayabu et al 1999). The system\n",
    "is then thrown into the La Niña state with strong trades, and a very\n",
    "cold tongue along the equator in the east.\n",
    "\n",
    "La Niña tends to last longer than El Niño, and the cycle from La Niña to\n",
    "El Niño and back takes about three years. The cycle isn’t exact. El Niño\n",

    "##### Equatorial Kelvin and Rossby Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelvin and Rossby waves are the ocean’s way of adjusting to changes in\n",
    "forcing such as westerly wind bursts. The adjustment occurs as waves of\n",
    "current and sea level that are influenced by gravity, Coriolis force\n",
    "$f$, and the north-south variation of Coriolis force\n",
    "$\\partial f/\\partial y = \\beta$. There are many kinds of these waves\n",
    "with different frequencies, wavelengths, and velocities. If gravity and\n",
    "$f$ are the restoring forces, the waves are called Kelvin and Poincaré\n",
    "waves. If $\\beta$ is the restoring force, the waves are called planetary\n",
    "waves. One important type of planetary wave is the Rossby wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of waves are especially important for El Niño: internal Kelvin\n",
    "waves and Rossby waves. Both waves can have modes that are confined to a\n",
    "narrow, north-south region centered on the equator. These are\n",
    "*equatorially trapped waves*. Both exist in slightly different forms at\n",
    "higher latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelvin and Rossby wave theory is beyond the scope of this book, so I\n",
    "will just tell you what they are without deriving the properties of the\n",
    "waves. If you are curious, you can find the details in Philander (1990):\n",

    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Equatorial processes are important because heat released by rain in\n",
    "    the equatorial region helps drives much of the atmospheric\n",
    "    circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Solar energy absorbed by the Pacific is the most important driver of\n",
    "    atmospheric circulation. Solar energy is lost from the ocean mainly\n",
    "    by evaporation. The heat warms the atmosphere and drives the\n",
    "    circulation when the latent heat of evaporation is released in rainy\n",
    "    areas, primarily in the western tropical Pacific and the\n",
    "    Intertropical Convergence Zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The interannual variability of currents and temperatures in the\n",
    "    equatorial Pacific modulates the oceanic forcing of the atmosphere.\n",
    "    This interannual variability is associated with El Niño/La Niña.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changes in equatorial dynamics cause changes in atmospheric\n",
    "    circulation by changing the location of rain in tropical Pacific and\n",
    "    therefore the location of the major heat source driving the\n",
    "    atmospheric circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    El Niño causes the biggest changes in equatorial dynamics. During El\n",
    "    Niño, trade-winds weaken in the western Pacific, the thermocline\n",
    "    becomes less deep in the west. This drives a Kelvin wave eastward\n",
    "    along the equator, which deepens the thermocline in the eastern\n",
    "    Pacific. The warm pool in the west moves eastward toward the central\n",
    "    Pacific, and the intense tropical rain areas move with the warm\n",
    "    pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "    El Ni\\[̃n\\]o is the largest source of year-to-year fluctuations in\n",
    "    global weather patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As a result of El Niño, drought occurs in the Indonesian area and\n",
    "    northern Australia, and floods occur in western, tropical South\n",
    "    America. Variations in the atmospheric circulation influence more\n",
    "    distant areas through teleconnections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Forecasts of El Niño are made using coupled ocean-atmospheric\n",
    "    numerical models. Forecasts appear to have useful accuracy for 3–6\n",
    "    months in advance, mostly after the onset of El Niño."
