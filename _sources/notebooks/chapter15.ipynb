    "# Numerical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw earlier that analytic solutions of the equations of motion are\n",
    "impossible to obtain for typical oceanic flows. The problem is due to\n",
    "non-linear terms in the equations of motion, turbulence, and the need\n",
    "for realistic shapes for the sea floor and coastlines. We have also seen\n",
    "how difficult it is to describe the ocean from measurements. Satellites\n",
    "can observe some processes almost everywhere every few days. But they\n",
    "observe only some processes, and only near or at the surface. Ships and\n",
    "floats can measure more variables, and deeper into the water, but the\n",
    "measurements are sparse. Hence, numerical models provide the only\n",
    "useful, global view of ocean currents. Let’s look at the accuracy and\n",
    "validity of the models, keeping in mind that although they are only\n",
    "models, they provide a remarkably detailed and realistic view of the\n",
    "ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction–Some Words of Caution\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical models of ocean currents have many advantages. They simulate\n",
    "flows in realistic ocean basins with a realistic sea floor. They include\n",
    "the influence of viscosity and non-linear dynamics. And they can\n",
    "calculate possible future flows in the ocean. Perhaps, most important,\n",
    "they interpolate between sparse observations of the ocean produced by\n",
    "ships, drifters, and satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical models are not without problems. “There is a world of\n",
    "difference between the character of the fundamental laws, on the one\n",
    "hand, and the nature of the computations required to breathe life into\n",
    "them, on the other”—Berlinski (1996). The models can never give\n",
    "complete descriptions of the oceanic flows even if the equations are\n",
    "integrated accurately. The problems arise from several sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Discrete equations are not the same as continuous equations.* In\n",
    "Chapter 7 we wrote down the differential equations describing the motion\n",
    "of a continuous fluid. Numerical models use algebraic approximations to\n",
    "the differential equations. We assume that the ocean basins are filled\n",
    "with a grid of points, and time moves forward in tiny steps. The value\n",
    "of the current, pressure, temperature, and salinity are calculated from\n",
    "their values at nearby points and previous times. Ian Stewart (1992), a\n",
    "noted mathematician, points out that\n",
    "\n",
    "> Discretization is essential for computer implementation and cannot be\n",
    "> dispensed with. The essence of the difficulty is that the dynamics of\n",
    "> discrete systems is only loosely related to that of continuous\n",
    "> systems—indeed the dynamics of discrete systems is far richer than\n",
    "> that of their continuous counterparts—and the approximations\n",
    "> involved can create spurious solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Calculations of turbulence are difficult.* Numerical models provide\n",
    "information only at grid points of the model. They provide no\n",
    "information about the flow between the points. Yet, the ocean is\n",
    "turbulent, and any oceanic model capable of resolving the turbulence\n",
    "needs grid points spaced millimeters apart, with time steps of\n",
    "milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical ocean models have grid points spaced tens to hundreds of\n",
    "kilometers apart in the horizontal, and tens to hundreds of meters apart\n",
    "in the vertical. This means that turbulence cannot be calculated\n",
    "directly, and the influence of turbulence must be parameterized.\n",
    "Holloway (1994) states the problem succinctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ocean models retain fewer degrees of freedom than the actual ocean (by\n",
    "> about 20 orders of magnitude). We compensate by applying ‘eddy-viscous\n",
    "> goo’ to squash motion at all but the smallest retained scales. (We\n",
    "> also use non-conservative numerics.) This is analogous to placing a\n",
    "> partition in a box to prevent gas molecules from invading another\n",
    "> region of the box. Our oceanic models cannot invade most of the real\n",
    "> oceanic degrees of freedom simply because the models do not include\n",
    "> them.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Given that we cannot do things ‘right’, is it better to do nothing?\n",
    "> That is not an option. ‘Nothing’ means applying viscous goo and\n",
    "> wishing for the ever bigger computer. Can we do better? For example,\n",
    "> can we guess a higher entropy configuration toward which the eddies\n",
    "> tend to drive the ocean (that tendency to compete with the imposed\n",
    "> forcing and dissipation)?\n",
    "\n",
    "By “degrees of freedom” Holloway means all possible motions from the\n",
    "smallest waves and turbulence to the largest currents. Let’s do a\n",
    "calculation. We know that the ocean is turbulent with eddies as small as\n",
    "a few millimeters. To completely describe the ocean we need a model with\n",
    "grid points spaced 1 mm apart and time steps of about 1 ms. The model\n",
    "must therefore have 360 $\\times$ 180$\\times$ (111\n",
    "km/degree)$^2 \\times 10^{12}$ (mm/km)$^2 \\times$ 3 km $\\times 10^6$\n",
    "(mm/km) $= 2.4 \\times 10^{27}$ data points for a 3 km deep ocean\n",
    "covering the globe. The global Parallel Ocean Program Model described in\n",
    "the next section has $2.2 \\times 10^7$ points. So we need $10^{20}$ times more points to describe\n",
    "the real ocean. These are the missing $10^{20}$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Practical models must be simpler than the real ocean.* Models of the\n",
    "ocean must run on available computers. This means oceanographers further\n",
    "simplify their models. We use the hydrostatic and Boussinesq\n",
    "approximations, and we often use equations integrated in the vertical,\n",
    "the shallow-water equations (Haidvogel and Beckmann, 1999: 37). We do\n",
    "this because we cannot yet run the most detailed models of oceanic\n",
    "circulation for thousands of years to understand the role of the ocean\n",
    "in climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Numerical code has errors.* Do you know of any software without bugs?\n",
    "Numerical models use many subroutines each with many lines of code which\n",
    "are converted into instructions understood by processors using other\n",
    "software called a compiler. Eliminating all software errors is\n",
    "impossible. With careful testing, the output may be correct, but the\n",
    "accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Plus, numerical calculations cannot be\n",
    "more accurate than the accuracy of the floating-point numbers and\n",
    "integers used by the computer. Round-off errors cannot be ignored.\n",
    "Lawrence et al (1999), examining the output of an atmospheric numerical\n",
    "model found an error in the code produced by the\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">fortran-90</span> compiler used on the <span class=\"smallcaps\">cray</span>\n",
    "Research supercomputer used to run the code. They also found round-off\n",
    "errors in the concentration of tracers calculated from the model. Both\n",
    "errors produced important errors in the output of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most models are not well verified or validated (Post & Votta, 2005).\n",
    "Yet, without adequate verification and validation, output from numerical\n",
    "models is not credible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these many sources of error, most are small in practice.\n",
    "Numerical models of the ocean are giving the most detailed and complete\n",
    "views of the circulation available to oceanographers. Some of the\n",
    "simulations contain unprecedented details of the flow. I included the\n",
    "words of warning not to lead you to believe the models are wrong, but to\n",
    "lead you to accept the output with a grain of salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Models in Oceanography\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical models are very widely used for many purposes in oceanography.\n",
    "For our purpose we can divide models into two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mechanistic models\n",
    "\n",
    "are simplified models used for studying processes. Because the models\n",
    "are simplified, the output is easier to interpret than output from more\n",
    "complex models. Many different types of simplified models have been\n",
    "developed, including models for describing planetary waves, the\n",
    "interaction of the flow with sea-floor features, or the response of the\n",
    "upper ocean to the wind. These are perhaps the most useful of all models\n",
    "because they provide insight into the physical mechanisms influencing\n",
    "the ocean. The development and use of mechanistic models is,\n",
    "unfortunately, beyond the scope of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simulation models\n",
    "\n",
    "are used for calculating realistic circulation of oceanic regions. The\n",
    "models are often very complex because all important processes are\n",
    "included, and the output is difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first simulation model was developed by Kirk Bryan and Michael Cox\n",
    "(Bryan, 1969) at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory in Princeton.\n",
    "They calculated the 3-dimensional flow in the ocean using the continuity\n",
    "and momentum equation with the hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations\n",
    "and a simple equation of state. Such models are called *primitive\n",
    "equation* models because they use the basic, or primitive form of the\n",
    "equations of motion. The equation of state allows the model to calculate\n",
    "changes in density due to fluxes of heat and water through the surface,\n",
    "so the model includes thermodynamic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bryan-Cox model used large horizontal and vertical viscosity and\n",
    "diffusion to eliminate turbulent eddies having diameters smaller about\n",
    "500 km, which is a few grid points in the model. It had complex\n",
    "coastlines, smoothed sea-floor features, and a rigid lid. The rigid lid\n",
    "was needed to eliminate ocean-surface waves, such as tides and tsunamis,\n",
    "that move far too fast for the coarse time steps used by all simulation\n",
    "models. The rigid lid had, however, disadvantages. Islands substantially\n",
    "slowed the computation, and the sea-floor features were smoothed to\n",
    "eliminate steep gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first simulation model was regional. It was quickly followed by a\n",
    "global model (Cox, 1975) with a horizontal resolution of 2 and with 12\n",
    "levels in the vertical. The model ran far too slowly even on the fastest\n",
    "computers of the day, but it laid the foundation for more recent models.\n",
    "The coarse spatial resolution required that the model have large values\n",
    "for viscosity, and even regional models were too viscous to have\n",
    "realistic western boundary currents or mesoscale eddies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since those times, the goal has been to produce models with ever finer\n",
    "resolution, more realistic modeling of physical processes, and better\n",
    "numerical schemes. Computer technology is changing rapidly, and models\n",
    "are evolving rapidly. The output from the most recent models of the\n",
    "north Atlantic, which have resolution of 0.03 look very much like the\n",
    "real ocean. Models of other areas show previously unknown currents near\n",
    "Australia and in the south Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ocean and Atmosphere Models\n",
    "\n",
    "use very different spacing of grid points. As a result, ocean modeling\n",
    "lags about a decade behind atmosphere modeling. Dominant ocean eddies\n",
    "are 1/30 the size of dominant atmosphere eddies (storms). But, ocean\n",
    "features evolve at a rate that is 1/30 the rate in the atmosphere. Thus\n",
    "ocean models running for say one year have $(30 \\times 30 )$ more\n",
    "horizontal grid points than the atmosphere, but they have 1/30 the\n",
    "number of time steps. Both have about the same number of grid points in\n",
    "the vertical. As a result, ocean models run 30 times slower than\n",
    "atmosphere models of the same complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Ocean Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Several types of global models are widely used in oceanography. Most\n",
    "have grid points about one tenth of a degree apart, which is sufficient\n",
    "to resolve mesoscale eddies, such as those seen in figures 11.10, 11.11,\n",
    "and 15.2, that have a diameter larger than two to three times the\n",
    "distance between grid points. Vertical resolution is typically around 30\n",
    "vertical levels. Models include: i) realistic coasts and bottom\n",
    "features; ii) heat and water fluxes though the surface; iii) eddy\n",
    "dynamics; and iv) the meridional-overturning circulation. Many\n",
    "assimilate satellite and float data using techniques described in §15.5.\n",
    "The models range in complexity from those that can run on desktop\n",
    "workstations to those that require the world’s fastest computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models must be be run to calculate one to two decades of variability\n",
    "before they can be used to simulate the ocean. This is called *spin-up*.\n",
    "Spin-up is needed because initial conditions for density, fluxes of\n",
    "momentum and heat through the sea-surface, and the equations of motion\n",
    "are not all consistent. Models are started from rest with values of\n",
    "density from the Levitus (1982) atlas and integrated for a decade using\n",
    "mean-annual wind stress, heat fluxes, and water flux. The model may be\n",
    "integrated for several more years using monthly wind stress, heat\n",
    "fluxes, and water fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bryan-Cox models evolved into several widely used models which are\n",
    "providing impressive views of the global ocean circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Modular Ocean Model MOM\n",
    "\n",
    "consistsof a large set of modules that can be configured to run on many\n",
    "different computersto model many different aspects of the circulation.\n",
    "The source code is open and free, and it is in the public domain. The\n",
    "model is widely use for climate studies and for studying the ocean’s\n",
    "circulation over a wide range of space and time scales (Pacanowski and\n",
    "Griffies, 1999).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because <span class=\"smallcaps\">mom</span> is used to investigate processes which cover\n",
    "> a wide range of time and space scales, the code and manual are\n",
    "> lengthy. However, it is far from necessary for the typical ocean\n",
    "> modeler to become acquainted with all of its aspects. Indeed,\n",
    "> <span class=\"smallcaps\">mom</span> can be likened to a growing city with many different\n",
    "> neighborhoods. Some of the neighborhoods communicate with one another,\n",
    "> some are mutually incompatible, and others are basically independent.\n",
    "> This diversity is quite a challenge to coordinate and support. Indeed,\n",
    "> over the years certain “neighborhoods” have been jettisoned or greatly\n",
    "> renovated for various reasons.—Pacanowski and Griffies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the momentum equations, equation of state, and the\n",
    "hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. Subgrid-scale motions are\n",
    "reduced by use of eddy viscosity. Version 4 of the model has improved\n",
    "numerical schemes, a free surface, realistic bottom features, and many\n",
    "types of mixing including horizontal mixing along surfaces of constant\n",
    "density. Plus, it can be coupled to atmospheric models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parallel Ocean Program Model\n",
    "\n",
    "produced by Smith and colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory\n",
    "(Maltrud et al, 1998) is another widely used model growing out of the\n",
    "original Bryan-Cox code. The model includes improved numerical\n",
    "algorithms, realistic coasts, islands, and unsmoothed bottom features.\n",
    "It has model has $1280 \\times 896$ equally spaced grid points on a\n",
    "Mercator projection extending from 77 S to 77N, and 20 levels in the\n",
    "vertical. Thus it has $2.2 \\times 10^{7}$ points giving a resolution of $0.28^{\\circ} \\times 0.28^{\\circ} \\cos \\theta$, which varies from 0.28 (31.25 km) at the\n",
    "equator to 0.06 (6.5 km) at the highest latitudes. The average\n",
    "resolution is about $0.2^{\\circ}$. The model was is forced by\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> wind stress and surface heat and water fluxes\n",
    "(Barnier et al, 1995).\n",

    "ocean. The direction is the mean direction of the current. From Richard\n",
    "Smith, Los Alamos National Laboratory. <span id=\"fig:model_out\" label=\"fig:model_out\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">hycom</span> All the models just described use $x, y, z$\n",
    "coordinates. Such a coordinate system has both advantages and\n",
    "disadvantages. It can have high resolution in the surface mixed layer\n",
    "and in shallower regions. But it is less useful in the interior of the\n",
    "ocean. Below the mixed layer, mixing in the ocean is easy along surfaces\n",
    "of constant density, and difficult across such surfaces. A more natural\n",
    "coordinate system in the interior of the ocean uses $x, y, \\rho$, where\n",
    "$\\rho$ is density. Such a model is called an *isopycnal model*.\n",
    "Essentially, $\\rho (z)$ is replaced with $z (\\rho )$. Because isopycnal\n",
    "surfaces are surfaces of constant density, horizontal mixing is always\n",
    "on constant-density surfaces in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model <span class=\"smallcaps\">hycom</span> model uses\n",
    "different vertical coordinates in different regions of the ocean,\n",
    "combining the best aspects of $z$-coordinate model and\n",
    "isopycnal-coordinate model (Bleck, 2002). The hybrid model has evolved\n",
    "from the Miami Isopycnic-Coordinate Ocean Model (figure 15.2). It is a\n",
    "primitive-equation model driven by wind stress and heat fluxes. It has\n",
    "realistic mixed layer and improved horizontal and vertical mixing\n",
    "schemes that include the influences of internal waves, shear\n",
    "instability, and double-diffusion (see §8.5). The model results from\n",
    "collaborative work among investigators at many oceanographic\n",
    "laboratories.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regional Oceanic Modeling System\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">roms</span> is a regional model that can be embedded in models of\n",
    "much larger regions. It is widely used for studying coastal current\n",
    "systems closely tied to flow further offshore, for example, the\n",
    "California Current. <span class=\"smallcaps\">roms</span> is a hydrostatic, primitive\n",
    "equation, terrain-following model using stretched vertical coordinates,\n",
    "driven by surface fluxes of momentum, heat, and water. It has improved\n",
    "surface and bottom boundary layers (Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2004).\n",

    "variability, and the circulation of the north Atlantic. From Bleck.\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:blecksgulfstream\" label=\"fig:blecksgulfstream\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Climate models\n",
    "\n",
    "are used for studies of large-scale hydrographic structure, climate\n",
    "dynamics, and water-mass formation. These models are the same as the\n",
    "eddy-admitting, primitive equation models I have just described except\n",
    "the horizontal resolution is much coarser because they must simulate\n",
    "ocean processes for decades or centuries. As a result, they must have\n",
    "high dissipation for numerical stability, and they cannot simulate\n",
    "mesoscale eddies. Typical horizontal resolutions are 2 to 4. The models\n",
    "tend, however, to have high vertical resolution necessary for describing\n",
    "the deep circulation important for climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coastal Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The great economic importance of the coastal zone has led to the\n",
    "development of many different numerical models for describing coastal\n",
    "currents, tides, and storm surges. The models extend from the beach to\n",
    "the continental slope, and they can include a free surface, realistic\n",
    "coasts and bottom features, river runoff, and atmospheric forcing.\n",
    "Because the models don’t extend very far into deep water, they need\n",
    "additional information about deep-water currents or conditions at the\n",
    "shelf break.\n",
    "\n",
    "The many different coastal models have many different goals, and many\n",
    "different implementations. Several of the models described above,\n",
    "including <span class=\"smallcaps\">mom</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">rom</span>, have been used to\n",
    "model coastal processes. But many other specialized models have also\n",
    "been developed. Heaps (1987), Lynch et al (1996), and Haidvogel and\n",
    "Beckman (1998) provide good overviews of the subject. Rather than look\n",
    "at a menu of models, let’s look at two typical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Princeton Ocean Model* developed by Blumberg and Mellor (1987, and\n",
    "Mellor, 1998) and is widely used for describing coastal currents. It\n",
    "includes thermodynamic processes, turbulent mixing, and the Boussinesq\n",
    "and hydrostatic approximations. The Coriolis parameter is allowed to\n",
    "vary using a beta-plane approximation. Because the model must include a\n",
    "wide range of depths, Blumberg and Mellor used a vertical coordinate\n",
    "$\\sigma$ scaled by the depth of the water:\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\frac{z-\\eta}{H+\\eta}$$ where $z=\\eta(x, y, t)$ is the sea\n",
    "surface, and $z=-H(x,y)$ is the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-grid turbulence is parameterized using a closure scheme proposed by\n",
    "Mellor and Yamada (1982) whereby eddy diffusion coefficients vary with\n",
    "the size of the eddies producing the mixing and the shear of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is driven by wind stress and heat and water fluxes from\n",
    "meteorological models. The model uses known geostrophic, tidal, and\n",
    "Ekman currents at the outer boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has been used to calculate the three-dimensional distribution\n",
    "of velocity, salinity, sea level, temperature, and turbulence for up to\n",
    "30 days over a region roughly 100–1000 km on a side with grid spacing\n",
    "of 1–50 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dartmouth Gulf of Maine Model* developed by Lynch et al (1996) is a\n",
    "3-dimensional model of the circulation using a triangular,\n",
    "finite-element grid. The size of the triangles is proportional to both\n",
    "depth and the rate of change of depth. The triangles are small in\n",
    "regions where the bottom slopes are large and the depth is shallow, and\n",
    "they are large in deep water. The variable mesh is especially useful in\n",
    "coastal regions where the depth of water varies greatly. Thus the\n",
    "variable grid gives highest resolution where it is most needed.\n",

    "Triangular, finite-element grid used to compute flow in the gulf. The\n",
    "size of the triangles varies with depth and rate of change of depth.\n",
    "After Lynch et al, (1996). <span id=\"fig:GulfofMaine\" label=\"fig:GulfofMaine\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses roughly 13,000 triangles to cover the Gulf of Maine and\n",
    "nearby waters of the north Atlantic (figures 15.3). Minimum size of the\n",
    "elements is roughly one kilometer. The model has 10 to 40 horizontal\n",
    "layers. The vertical spacing of the layers is not uniform. Layers are\n",
    "closer together near the top and bottom and they are more widely spaced\n",
    "in the interior. Minimum spacing is roughly one meter in the bottom\n",
    "boundary layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model integrates the three-dimensional, primitive equations in\n",
    "shallow-water form. The model has a simplified equation of state and a\n",
    "depth-averaged continuity equation, and it uses the hydrostatic and\n",
    "Boussinesq assumptions. Sub-grid mixing of momentum, heat and mass is\n",
    "parameterized using the Mellor and Yamada (1982) turbulence-closure\n",

    "##### Storm-Surge Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Storms coming ashore across wide, shallow, continental shelves drive\n",
    "large changes of sea level at the coast called storm surges (see §17.3\n",
    "for a description of surges and processes influencing surges). The\n",
    "surges can cause great damage to coasts and coastal structures. Intense\n",
    "storms in the Bay of Bengal have killed hundreds of thousands in a few\n",
    "days in Bangladesh. Because surges are so important, government agencies\n",
    "in many countries have developed models to predict the changes of sea\n",
    "level and the extent of coastal flooding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating storm surges is not easy. Here are some reasons, in a rough\n",
    "order of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of wind over the ocean is not well known. Numerical\n",
    "weather models calculate wind speed at a constant pressure surface,\n",
    "storm-surge models need wind at a constant height of 10 m. Winds in bays\n",
    "and lagoons tend to be weaker than winds just offshore because nearby\n",
    "land distorts the airflow, and this is not included in the weather\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shoreward extent of the model’s domain changes with time. For\n",
    "example, if sea level rises, water will flood inland, and the boundary\n",
    "between water and sea moves inland with the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drag coefficient of wind on water is not well known for hurricane\n",
    "force winds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drag coefficient of water on the seafloor is also not well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models must include waves and tides which influence sea level in\n",
    "shallow waters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm surge models must include the currents generated in a stratified,\n",
    "shallow sea by wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce errors, models are tuned to give results that match conditions\n",
    "seen in past storms. Unfortunately, those past conditions are not well\n",
    "known. Changes in sea level and wind speed are rarely recorded\n",
    "accurately in storms except at a few, widely paced locations. Yet\n",
    "storm-surge heights can change by more than a meter over distances of\n",
    "tens of kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these problems, models give very useful results. Let’s look at\n",
    "the official <span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> model, and a new experimental model\n",
    "developed by the Corps of Engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges Model* <span class=\"smallcaps\">slosh</span> is used by\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> for forecasting storm surges produced by hurricanes\n",

    "(Jelesnianski, Chen, and Shaffer, 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is the result of a lifetime of work by Chester Jelesnianski.\n",
    "In developing the model, Jelesnianski paid careful attention to the\n",
    "relative importance of errors in the model. He worked to reduce the\n",
    "largest errors, and ignored the smaller ones. For example, the\n",
    "distribution of winds in a hurricane is not well known, so it makes\n",
    "little sense to use a spatially varying drag coefficient for the wind.\n",
    "Thus, Jelesnianski used a constant drag coefficient in the air, and a\n",
    "constant eddy stress coefficient in the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">slosh</span> calculates water level from depth-integrated,\n",
    "quasi-linear, shallow-water equations. Thus it ignores stratification.\n",
    "It also ignores river inflow, rain, and tides. The latter may seem\n",
    "strange, but the model is designed for forecasting. The time of landfall\n",
    "cannot be forecast accurately, and hence the height of the tides is\n",
    "mostly unknown. Tides can be added to the calculated surge, but the\n",
    "nonlinear interaction of tides and surge is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is forced by idealized hurricane winds. It needs only\n",
    "atmospheric pressure at the center of the storm, the distance from the\n",
    "center to the area of maximum winds, the forecast storm track and speed\n",
    "along the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for hurricanes coming ashore near populated areas, the\n",
    "model has been adapted for 27 basins from Boston Harbor Massachusetts to\n",

    "## Assimilation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the models I have described so far have output, such as current\n",
    "velocity or surface topography, constrained by oceanic observations of\n",
    "the variables they calculate. Such models are called *assimilation\n",
    "models*. In this section, I will consider how data can be assimilated\n",
    "into numerical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin with a primitive-equation, eddy-admitting numerical model\n",
    "used to calculate the position of the Gulf Stream. Let’s assume that the\n",
    "model is driven with real-time surface winds from the\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> weather model. Using the model, we can calculate the\n",
    "position of the current and also the sea-surface topography associated\n",
    "with the current. We find that the position of the Gulf Stream wiggles\n",
    "offshore of Cape Hatteras due to instabilities, and the position\n",
    "calculated by the model is just one of many possible positions for the\n",
    "same wind forcing. Which position is correct, that is, what is the\n",
    "position of the current today? We know, from satellite altimetry, the\n",
    "position of the current at a few points a few days ago. Can we use this\n",
    "information to calculate the current’s position today? How do we\n",
    "assimilate this information into the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different approaches are being explored (Malanotte-Rizzoli, 1996).\n",
    "Roger Daley (1991) gives a complete description of how data are used\n",
    "with atmospheric models. Andrew Bennet (1992) and Carl Wunsch (1996)\n",
    "describe oceanic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different approaches are necessary because assimilation of data into\n",
    "models is not easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data assimilation is an *inverse problem*: A finite number of\n",
    "observations are used to estimate a continuous field—a function, which\n",
    "has an infinite number of points. The calculated fields, the solution to\n",
    "the inverse problem, are completely under-determined. There are many\n",
    "fields that fit the observations and the model precisely, and the\n",
    "solutions are not unique. In our example, the position of the Gulf\n",
    "Stream is a function. We may not need an infinite number of values to\n",
    "specify the position of the stream if we assume the position is somewhat\n",
    "smooth in space. But we certainly need hundreds of values along the\n",
    "stream’s axis. Yet, we have only a few satellite points to constrain the\n",
    "position of the Stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about inverse problems and their solution, read Parker\n",
    "(1994) who gives a very good introduction based on geophysical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocean dynamics are non-linear, while most methods for calculating\n",
    "solutions to inverse problems depend on linear approximations. For\n",
    "example the position of the Gulf Stream is a very nonlinear function of\n",
    "the forcing by wind and heat fluxes over the north Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the model and the data are incomplete and both have errors. For\n",
    "example, we have altimeter measurements only along the tracks such as\n",
    "those shown in figure 2.6, and the measurements have errors of $\\pm 2$\n",
    "cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data available for assimilation into data comes from the surface,\n",
    "such as <span class=\"smallcaps\">avhrr</span> and altimeter data. Surface data obviously\n",
    "constrain the surface geostrophic velocity, and surface velocity is\n",
    "related to deeper velocities. The trick is to couple the surface\n",
    "observations to deeper currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "While various techniques are used to constrain numerical models in\n",
    "oceanography, perhaps the most practical are techniques borrowed from\n",
    "meteorology.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most major ocean currents have dynamics which are significantly\n",

    "> methods…Accordingly, most attempts to combine ocean models and\n",
    "> measurements have followed the practice in operational meteorology:\n",
    "> measurements are used to prepare initial conditions for the model,\n",
    "> which is then integrated forward in time until further measurements\n",

    "> may be described as sequential.—Bennet (1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how Professor Allan Robinson and colleagues at Harvard\n",

    "model of the Gulf Stream east of Cape Hatteras (Robinson et al. 1989).\n",
    "It had six levels in the vertical, 15 km resolution, and one-hour time\n",

    "\n",
    "By *quasi-geostrophic* we mean that the flow field is close to\n",
    "geostrophic balance. The equations of motion include the acceleration\n",
    "terms $D/Dt$, where $D/Dt$ is the substantial derivative and $t$ is\n",
    "time. The flow can be stratified, but there is no change in density due\n",
    "to heat fluxes or vertical mixing. Thus the quasi-geostrophic equations\n",
    "are simpler than the primitive equations, and they could be integrated\n",
    "much faster. Cushman-Roisin (1994: 204) gives a good description of the\n",
    "development of quasi-geostrophic equations of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model reproduces the important features of the Gulf Stream and it’s\n",
    "extension, including meanders, cold- and warm-core rings, the\n",
    "interaction of rings with the stream, and baroclinic instability (figure\n",
    "15.4). Because the model was designed to forecast the dynamics of the\n",
    "Gulf Stream, it must be constrained by oceanic measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data provide the initial conditions for the model. Satellite\n",
    "measurements of sea-surface temperature from the <span class=\"smallcaps\">avhrr</span> and\n",

    "The data are introduced into the numerical model, which interpolates and\n",
    "smoothes the data to produce the best estimate of the initial fields of\n",

    "\n",
    "The model is integrated forward for one week, when new data are\n",
    "available, to produce a forecast.\n",

    "Other important uses of coupled models include studies of El Niño and\n",

    "modified version of the Princeton Modular Ocean Model, using the Gent\n",
    "and McWilliams (1990) scheme for parameterizing mesoscale eddies.\n",
    "Resolution is approximately 2 $\\times$ 2 with 45 vertical levels in the\n",
    "ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has been spun up and integrated for 300 years, the results are\n",
    "realistic, and there is no need for a flux adjustment. (See the special\n",
    "issue of *Journal of Climate*, June 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Princeton Coupled Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of an atmospheric model with a horizontal resolution\n",
    "of 7.5 longitude by 4.5 latitude and 9 levels in the vertical, an ocean\n",
    "model with a horizontal resolution of 4 and 12 levels in the vertical,\n",
    "and a land-surface model. The ocean and atmosphere are coupled through\n",
    "heat, water, and momentum fluxes. Land and ocean are coupled through\n",
    "river runoff. And land and atmosphere are coupled through water and heat\n",
    "fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hadley Center Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an atmosphere-ocean-ice model that minimizes the need for flux\n",
    "adjustments (Johns et al, 1997). The ocean component is based on the\n",
    "Bryan-Cox primitive equation model, with realistic bottom features,\n",
    "vertical mixing coefficients from Pacanowski and Philander (1981). Both\n",
    "the ocean and the atmospheric component have a horizontal resolution of\n",
    "96 $\\times$ 73 grid points, the ocean has 20 levels in the vertical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to most coupled models, this one is spun up as a coupled\n",
    "system with flux adjustments during spin up to keep sea surface\n",
    "temperature and salinity close to observed mean values. The coupled\n",
    "model was integrated from rest using Levitus values for temperature and\n",
    "salinity for September. The initial integration was from 1850 to 1940.\n",
    "The model was then integrated for another 1000 years. No flux adjustment\n",

    "\n",
    "> It will be very hard to establish an integration framework,\n",

    "Because models must be simplified to run on existing computers, the\n",
    "models must be simpler than models that simulate flow for a few years\n",
    "(<span class=\"smallcaps\">wcrp</span>, 1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the coupled model must be integrated for many years for the\n",
    "ocean and atmosphere to approach equilibrium. As the integration\n",
    "proceeds, the coupled system tends to drift away from reality due to\n",
    "errors in calculating fluxes of heat and momentum between the ocean and\n",
    "atmosphere. For example, very small errors in precipitation over the\n",
    "Antarctic Circumpolar Current leads to small changes the salinity of the\n",
    "current, which leads to large changes in deep convection in the Weddell\n",
    "Sea, which greatly influences the volume of deep water masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some modelers allow the system to drift, others adjust sea-surface\n",
    "temperature and the calculated fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere.\n",
    "Returning to the example, the flux of fresh water in the circumpolar\n",
    "current could be adjusted to keep salinity close to the observed value\n",
    "in the current. There is no good scientific basis for the adjustments\n",
