    "# Ocean Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking out to sea from the shore, we can see waves on the sea surface.\n",
    "Looking carefully, we notice the waves are undulations of the sea\n",
    "surface with a height of around a meter, where height is the vertical\n",
    "distance between the bottom of a trough and the top of a nearby crest.\n",
    "The wavelength, which we might take to be the distance between prominent\n",
    "crests, is around 50-100 meters. Watching the waves for a few minutes,\n",
    "we notice that wave height and wave length are not constant. The heights\n",
    "vary randomly in time and space, and the statistical properties of the\n",
    "waves, such as the mean height averaged for a few hundred waves, change\n",
    "from day to day. These prominent offshore waves are generated by wind.\n",
    "Sometimes the local wind generates the waves, other times distant storms\n",
    "generate waves which ultimately reach the coast. For example, waves\n",
    "breaking on the Southern California coast on a summer day may come from\n",
    "vast storms offshore of Antarctica 10,000 km away.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we watch closely for a long time, we notice that sea level changes\n",
    "from hour to hour. Over a period of a day, sea level increases and\n",
    "decreases relative to a point on the shore by about a meter. The slow\n",
    "rise and fall of sea level is due to the tides, another type of wave on\n",
    "the sea surface. Tides have wavelengths of thousands of kilometers, and\n",
    "they are generated by the slow, very small changes in gravity due to the\n",
    "motion of the sun and the moon relative to earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter you will learn how to describe ocean-surface waves\n",
    "quantitatively. In the next chapter I will describe tides and waves\n",
    "along coasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Theory of Ocean Surface Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface waves are inherently nonlinear: The solution of the equations of\n",
    "motion depends on the surface boundary conditions, but the surface\n",
    "boundary conditions are the waves we wish to calculate. How can we\n",
    "proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by assuming that the amplitude of waves on the water surface is\n",
    "infinitely small so the surface is almost exactly a plane. To simplify\n",
    "the mathematics, we can also assume that the flow is 2-dimensional with\n",
    "waves traveling in the $x$-direction. We also assume that the Coriolis\n",
    "force and viscosity can be neglected. If we retain rotation, we get\n",
    "Kelvin waves discussed in §14.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions, the sea-surface elevation $\\zeta$ of a wave\n",
    "traveling in the $x$ direction is:\n",
    "$$\\zeta = a \\sin (k \\, x - \\omega \\, t)$$ with $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\omega = 2 \\pi f = \\frac{2 \\pi}{T}; & & k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{L}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is wave frequency in radians per second, $f$ is the wave\n",
    "frequency in Hertz (Hz), $k$ is wave number, $T$ is wave period, $L$ is\n",
    "wave length, and where we assume, as stated above, that $ka = O(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *wave period* $T$ is the time it takes two successive wave crests or\n",
    "troughs to pass a fixed point. The *wave length* $L$ is the distance\n",
    "between two successive wave crests or troughs at a fixed time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dispersion Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave frequency $\\omega$ is related to wave number $k$ by the *dispersion\n",
    "relation* (Lamb, 1945 §228): $$\\omega ^{2} = g \\, k \\tanh (k d)$$ where\n",
    "$d$ is the water depth and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two approximations are especially useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *Deep-water approximation* is valid if the water depth $d$ is much\n",
    "    greater than the wave length $L$. In this case, $d \\gg L$,\n",
    "    $kd \\gg 1$, and $\\tanh (kd) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  *Shallow-water approximation* is valid if the water depth is much\n",
    "    less than a wavelength. In this case, $d \\ll L$, $kd \\ll 1$, and\n",
    "    $\\tanh (kd) = kd$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these two limits of water depth compared with wavelength the\n",
    "dispersion relation reduces to: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  \\omega ^2 &= g \\, k & & \\text{Deep-water dispersion relation}\\\\\n",
    "  d &> L/4 & &  \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "   & & \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "  \\omega ^2 &= g \\, k^{2} \\, d & & \\text{Shallow-water dispersion relation}\\\\\n",
    "   d &< L/11 & & \\nonumber\\end{aligned}$$ The stated limits for $d/L$\n",
    "give a dispersion relation accurate within 10%. Because many wave\n",
    "properties can be measured with accuracies of 5–10%, the approximations\n",
    "are useful for calculating wave properties. Later we will learn to\n",
    "calculate wave properties as the waves propagate from deep to shallow\n",
    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Phase Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase velocity $c$ is the speed at which a particular phase of the\n",
    "wave propagates, for example, the speed of propagation of the wave\n",
    "crest. In one wave period $T$ the crest advances one wave length $L$ and\n",
    "the phase speed is $c=L/T= \\omega /k$. Thus, the definition of phase\n",
    "speed is: $$c \\equiv \\frac {\\omega}{k}$$ The direction of propagation is\n",
    "perpendicular to the wave crest and toward the positive $x$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep- and shallow-water approximations for the dispersion relation\n",
    "give: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "   c &= \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{k}} = \\frac{g}{\\omega} & & \\text{ Deep-water phase\n",
    "velocity} \\\\\n",
    "   & &  & \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "   c &=\\sqrt{g\\,d} & & \\text{ Shallow-water phase velocity}\n",
    "  \\end{aligned}$$ The approximations are accurate to about 5% for limits\n",
    "stated in (16.4, 16.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep water, the phase speed depends on wave length or wave frequency.\n",
    "Longer waves travel faster. Thus, deep-water waves are said to be\n",
    "dispersive. In shallow water, the phase speed is independent of the\n",
    "wave; it depends only on the depth of the water. Shallow-water waves are\n",
    "non-dispersive.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Group Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of group velocity $c_{g}$ is fundamental for understanding\n",
    "the propagation of linear and nonlinear waves. First, it is the velocity\n",
    "at which a group of waves travels across the ocean. More importantly, it\n",
    "is also the propagation velocity of wave energy. Whitham (1974, §1.3 and\n",
    "§ 11.6) gives a clear derivation of the concept and the fundamental\n",
    "equation (16.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of group velocity in two dimensions is:\n",
    "$$c_{g} \\equiv \\frac {\\partial \\omega }{\\partial k}$$ Using the\n",
    "approximations for the dispersion relation: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    " c_{g} &= \\frac{g}{2\\omega} = \\frac{c}{2} & &   \\text{ Deep-water group velocity} \\\\\n",
    "  & & & \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    " c_{g} &= \\sqrt{g\\,d} \\, = c & &   \\text{ Shallow-water group velocity}\n",
    " \\end{aligned}$$ For ocean-surface waves, the direction of propagation\n",
    "is perpendicular to the wave crests in the positive $x$ direction. In\n",
    "the more general case of other types of waves, such as Kelvin and Rossby\n",
    "waves that we met in §14.2, the group velocity is not necessarily in the\n",
    "direction perpendicular to wave crests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that a group of deep-water waves moves at half the phase speed of\n",
    "the waves making up the group. How can this happen? If we could watch\n",
    "closely a group of waves crossing the sea, we would see waves crests\n",
    "appear at the back of the wave train, move through the train, and\n",
    "disappear at the leading edge of the group. Each wave crest moves at\n",
    "twice the speed of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do real ocean waves move in groups governed by the dispersion relation?\n",
    "Yes. Walter Munk and colleagues (1963) in a remarkable series of\n",
    "experiments in the 1960s showed that ocean waves propagating over great\n",
    "distances are dispersive, and that the dispersion could be used to track\n",
    "storms. They recorded waves for many days using an array of three\n",
    "pressure gauges just offshore of San Clemente Island, 60 miles due west\n",
    "of San Diego, California. Wave spectra were calculated for each day’s\n",
    "data. (The concept of a spectra is discussed below.) From the spectra,\n",
    "the amplitudes and frequencies of the low-frequency waves and the\n",
    "propagation direction of the waves were calculated. Finally, they\n",
    "plotted contours of wave energy on a frequency-time diagram (figure\n",
    "16.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the figure, consider a distant storm that produces waves\n",
    "of many frequencies. The lowest-frequency waves (smallest $\\omega$)\n",
    "travel the fastest (16.11), and they arrive before other,\n",
    "higher-frequency waves. The further away the storm, the longer the delay\n",
    "between arrivals of waves of different frequencies. The ridges of high\n",
    "wave energy seen in the figure are produced by individual storms. The\n",
    "slope of the ridge gives the distance to the storm in degrees $\\Delta$\n",
    "along a great circle; and the phase information from the array gives the\n",
    "angle to the storm $\\theta$. The two angles give the storm’s location\n",
    "relative to San Clemente. Thus waves arriving from 15 to 18 September\n",
    "produce a ridge indicating the storm was 115 away at an angle of\n",
    "205 which is south of new Zealand near Antarctica.\n",
    "\n",
    "The locations of the storms producing the waves recorded from June\n",
    "through October 1959 were compared with the location of storms plotted\n",
    "on weather maps and in most cases the two agreed well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 16.1 Contours\n",
    "\n",
    "of wave energy on a frequency-time plot calculated from spectra of waves\n",
    "measured by pressure gauges offshore of southern California. The ridges\n",
    "of high wave energy show the arrival of dispersed wave trains from\n",
    "distant storms. The slope of the ridge is inversely proportional to\n",
    "distance to the storm. $\\Delta$ is distance in degrees, $\\theta$ is\n",
    "direction of arrival of waves at California. After Munk et al. (1963).\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:dispersedwaves\" label=\"fig:dispersedwaves\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wave Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Wave energy $E$ in Joules per square meter is related to the variance of\n",
    "sea-surface displacement $\\zeta$ by:\n",
    "$$E = \\rho _{w} g \\, \\left< \\zeta ^{2} \\right>$$ where $\\rho _{w}$ is\n",
    "water density, $g$ is gravity, and the brackets denote a time or space\n",
    "average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 16.2 A short record\n",
    "\n",
    "of wave amplitude measured  \n",
    "by a wave buoy in the north Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:waveheight\" label=\"fig:waveheight\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Significant Wave Height\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by wave height? If we look at a wind-driven sea, we see\n",
    "waves of various heights. Some are much larger than most, others are\n",
    "much smaller (figure 16.2). A practical definition that is often used is\n",
    "the height of the highest 1/3 of the waves, $H_{1/3}$. The height is\n",
    "computed as follows: measure wave height for a few minutes, pick out say\n",
    "120 wave crests and record their heights. Pick the 40 largest waves and\n",
    "calculate the average height of the 40 values. This is $H_{1/3}$ for the\n",
    "wave record.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of significant wave height was developed during the World\n",
    "War II as part of a project to forecast ocean wave heights and periods.\n",
    "Wiegel (1964: p. 198) reports that work at the Scripps Institution of\n",
    "Oceanography showed\n",
    "\n",
    "> …wave height estimated by observers corresponds to the average of\n",
    "> the highest 20 to 40 per cent of waves…Originally, the term\n",
    "> significant wave height was attached to the average of these\n",
    "> observations, the highest 30 per cent of the waves, but has evolved to\n",
    "> become the average of the highest one-third of the waves, (designated\n",
    "> $H_S$ or $H_{1/3}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, significant wave height is calculated from measured wave\n",
    "displacement. If the sea contains a narrow range of wave frequencies,\n",
    "$H_{1/3}$ is related to the standard deviation of sea-surface\n",
    "displacement (<span class=\"smallcaps\">nas</span> , 1963: 22; Hoffman and Karst, 1975)\n",
    "$$H_{1/3} = 4 \\left< \\zeta ^{2}\\right>^{1/2}$$ where\n",
    "$\\left< \\zeta ^{2}\\right>^{1/2}$ is the standard deviation of surface\n",
    "displacement. This relationship is much more useful, and it is now the\n",
    "accepted way to calculate wave height from wave measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nonlinear waves\n",
    "\n",
    "We derived the properties of an ocean surface wave assuming the wave\n",
    "amplitude was infinitely small $ka = O(0)$. If $ka \\ll 1$ but not\n",
    "infinitely small, the wave properties can be expanded in a power series\n",
    "of $ka$ (Stokes, 1847). He calculated the properties of a wave of finite\n",
    "amplitude and found:\n",
    "$$\\zeta = a \\cos(kx - \\omega t) + \\frac{1}{2} k a^{2}\\cos 2(kx-\\omega t) +\n",
    "\\frac{3}{8} k^{2} a^{3} \\cos 3(k x - \\omega t) + \\cdots$$ The phases of\n",
    "the components for the Fourier series expansion of $\\zeta$ in (16.14)\n",
    "are such that non-linear waves have sharpened crests and flattened\n",
    "troughs. The maximum amplitude of the Stokes wave is $a_{max} = 0.07 L$\n",
    "($ka = 0.44$). Such steep waves in deep water are called Stokes waves\n",
    "(See also Lamb, 1945, §250).\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge of non-linear waves came slowly until Hasselmann (1961, 1963a,\n",
    "1963b, 1966), using the tools of high-energy particle physics, worked\n",
    "out to 6th order the interactions of three or more waves on the sea\n",
    "surface. He, Phillips (1960), and Longuet-Higgins and Phillips (1962)\n",
    "showed that $n$ free waves on the sea surface can interact to produce\n",
    "another free wave only if the frequencies and wave numbers of the\n",
    "interacting waves sum to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    " & \\omega _{1} \\pm \\omega _{2} \\pm \\omega _{3} \\pm \\cdots \\omega _{n}  = 0\n",
    "& \\\\\n",
    " & \\mathbf{k_{1}} \\pm  \\mathbf{k_{2}} \\pm  \\mathbf{k_{3}} \\pm \\cdots\n",
    "\\mathbf{k_{n}} =  0  &\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    " & \\omega_{i}^{2} = g \\, k_{i} &\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we allow waves to travel in any direction, and $\\mathbf{k_{i}}$ is\n",
    "the vector wave number giving wave length and direction. (16.15) are\n",
    "general requirements for any interacting waves. The fewest number of\n",
    "waves that meet the conditions of (16.15) are three waves which interact\n",
    "to produce a fourth. The interaction is weak; waves must interact for\n",
    "hundreds of wave lengths and periods to produce a fourth wave with\n",
    "amplitude comparable to the interacting waves. The Stokes wave does not\n",
    "meet the criteria of (16.15) and the wave components are not free waves;\n",
    "the higher harmonics are bound to the primary wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wave Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of wave momentum has caused considerable confusion\n",
    "(McIntyre, 1981). In general, waves do not have momentum, a mass flux,\n",
    "but they do have a momentum flux. This is true for waves on the sea\n",
    "surface. Ursell (1950) showed that ocean swell on a rotating earth has\n",
    "no mass transport. His proof seems to contradict the usual textbook\n",
    "discussions of steep, non-linear waves such as Stokes waves. Water\n",
    "particles in a Stokes wave move along paths that are nearly circular,\n",
    "but the paths fail to close, and the particles move slowly in the\n",
    "direction of wave propagation. This is a mass transport, and the\n",
    "phenomena is called Stokes drift. But the forward transport near the\n",
    "surface is balanced by an equal transport in the opposite direction at\n",
    "depth, and there is no net mass flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Waves and the Concept of a Wave Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look out to sea, we notice that waves on the sea surface are not\n",
    "sinusoids. The surface appears to be composed of random waves of various\n",
    "lengths and periods. How can we describe this surface? The answer is,\n",
    "Not very easily. We can however, with some simplifications, come close\n",
    "to describing the surface. The simplifications lead to the concept of\n",
    "the spectrum of ocean waves. The spectrum gives the distribution of wave\n",
    "energy among different wave frequencies or wave lengths on the sea\n",
    "surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a spectrum is based on work by Joseph Fourier\n",
    "(1768–1830), who showed that almost any function $\\zeta (t)$ (or\n",
    "$\\zeta (x)$ if you like), can be represented over the interval $-T/2 \\le t \\le T/2$ as the sum of an infinite series of sine and cosine\n",
    "functions with harmonic wave frequencies:\n",
    "$$\\zeta (t) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (a_n \\cos 2\\pi nft + b_n \\sin\n",
    "2\\pi nft)$$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "a_n &= \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \\zeta (t) \\cos 2\\pi nft \\, dt, \\qquad\n",
    "(n=0,1,2,\\ldots) \\\\\n",
    "b_n &= \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \\zeta (t) \\sin 2\\pi nft \\, dt, \\qquad\n",
    "(n=0,1,2,\\ldots)\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f = 1/ T$ is the fundamental frequency, and $nf$ are harmonics of the\n",
    "fundamental frequency. This form of $\\zeta (t)$ is called a *Fourier\n",
    "series* (Bracewell, 1986: 204; Whittaker and Watson, 1963: §9.1). Notice\n",
    "that $a_0$ is the mean value of $\\zeta (t)$ over the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations (16.18 and 16.19) can be simplified using\n",
    "$$\\exp (2\\pi inft) = \\cos (2\\pi nft) + i \\sin (2\\pi nft)$$ where\n",
    "$i = \\sqrt{-1}$. Equations (16.18 and 16.19) then become:\n",
    "$$\\zeta (t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} Z_n \\exp ^{i2\\pi nft}$$ where\n",
    "$$Z_n = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \\zeta (t) \\exp ^{-i2\\pi nft} \\, dt, \\qquad\n",
    "(n=0,1,2,\\ldots)$$ $Z_n$ is called the *Fourier transform* of\n",
    "$\\zeta (t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrum $S(f)$ of $\\zeta (t)$ is: $$S(nf) = Z_n Z^*_n$$ where $Z^*$\n",
    "is the complex conjugate of $Z$. We will use these forms for the Fourier\n",
    "series and spectra when we describing the computation of ocean wave\n",
    "spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand the idea of a Fourier series to include series that\n",
    "represent surfaces $\\zeta (x,y)$ using similar techniques. Thus, any\n",
    "surface can be represented as an infinite series of sine and cosine\n",
    "functions oriented in all possible directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s apply these ideas to the sea surface. Suppose for a moment\n",
    "that the sea surface were frozen in time. Using the Fourier expansion,\n",
    "the frozen surface can be represented as an infinite series of sine and\n",
    "cosine functions of different wave numbers oriented in all possible\n",
    "directions. If we unfreeze the surface and let it move, we can represent\n",
    "the sea surface as an infinite series of sine and cosine functions of\n",
    "different wave lengths moving in all directions. Because wave lengths\n",
    "and wave frequencies are related through the dispersion relation, we can\n",
    "also represent the sea surface as an infinite sum of sine and cosine\n",
    "functions of different frequencies moving in all directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in our discussion of Fourier series that we assume the coefficients\n",
    "$(a_n, b_n, Z_n)$ are constant. For times of perhaps an hour, and\n",
    "distances of perhaps tens of kilometers, the waves on the sea surface\n",
    "are sufficiently fixed that the assumption is true. Furthermore,\n",
    "non-linear interactions among waves are very weak. Therefore, we can\n",
    "represent a local sea surface by a linear superposition of real, sine\n",
    "waves having many different wave lengths or frequencies and different\n",
    "phases traveling in many different directions. The Fourier series in not\n",
    "just a convenient mathematical expression, it states that the sea\n",
    "surface is really, truly composed of sine waves, each one propagating\n",
    "according to the equations I wrote down in §16.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the sea surface being composed of independent waves can\n",
    "be carried further. Suppose I throw a rock into a calm ocean, making a\n",
    "big splash. According to Fourier, the splash can be represented as a\n",
    "superposition of cosine waves all of nearly zero phase so the waves add\n",
    "up to a big splash at the origin. Each individual Fourier wave begins to\n",
    "travel away from the splash. The longest waves travel fastest, and\n",
    "eventually, far from the splash, the sea consists of a dispersed train\n",
    "of waves with the longest waves further from the splash and the shortest\n",
    "waves closest. This is exactly what we see in figure 16.1. The storm\n",
    "makes the splash, and the waves disperse as seen in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sampling the Sea Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the Fourier series that represents the sea surface is\n",
    "perhaps impossible. It requires that we measure the height of the sea\n",
    "surface $\\zeta (x,y,t)$ everywhere in an area perhaps ten kilometers on\n",
    "a side for perhaps an hour. So, let’s simplify. Suppose we install a\n",
    "wave staff somewhere in the ocean and record the height of the sea\n",
    "surface as a function of time $\\zeta (t)$. We would obtain a record like\n",
    "that in figure 16.2. All waves on the sea surface will be measured, but\n",
    "we will know nothing about the direction of the waves. This is a much\n",
    "more practical measurement, and it will give the frequency spectrum of\n",
    "the waves on the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with a trace of wave height on say a piece of paper is\n",

    "##### Generation of Waves by Wind\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the last few paragraphs that waves are related to the\n",
    "wind. We have, however, put off until now just how they are generated by\n",
    "the wind. Suppose we begin with a mirror-smooth sea (Beaufort Number 0).\n",
    "What happens if the wind suddenly begins to blow steadily at say 8 m/s?\n",
    "Three different physical processes begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "The turbulence in the wind produces random pressure fluctuations at the\n",
    "sea surface, which produces small waves with wavelengths of a few\n",
    "centimeters (Phillips, 1957).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the wind acts on the small waves, causing them to become larger.\n",
    "Wind blowing over the wave produces pressure differences along the wave\n",
    "profile causing the wave to grow. The process is unstable because, as\n",
    "the wave gets bigger, the pressure differences get bigger, and the wave\n",
    "grows faster. The instability causes the wave to grow exponentially\n",
    "(Miles, 1957).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the waves begin to interact among themselves to produce longer\n",
    "waves (Hasselmann et al. 1973). The interaction transfers wave energy\n",
    "from short waves generated by Miles’ mechanism to waves with frequencies\n",
    "slightly lower than the frequency of waves at the peak of the spectrum.\n",
    "Eventually, this leads to waves going faster than the wind, as noted by\n",
    "Pierson and Moskowitz.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wave Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of ocean waves, their spectra, their generation by the\n",
    "wind, and their interactions are now sufficiently well understood that\n",
    "the wave spectrum can be forecast using winds calculated from numerical\n",
    "weather models. If we observe some small ocean area, or some area just\n",
    "offshore, we can see waves generated by the local wind, the *wind sea*,\n",
    "plus waves that were generated in other areas at other times and that\n",
    "have propagated into the area we are observing, the *swell*. Forecasts\n",
    "of local wave conditions must include both sea and swell, hence wave\n",
    "forecasting is not a local problem. We saw, for example, that waves off\n",
    "California can be generated by storms more than 10,000 km away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various techniques have been used to forecast waves. The earliest\n",
    "attempts were based on empirical relationships between wave height and\n",
    "wave length and wind speed, duration, and fetch. The development of the\n",
    "wave spectrum allowed evolution of individual wave components with\n",
    "frequency $f$ travelling in direction $\\theta$ of the directional wave\n",
    "spectrum $\\psi (f, \\theta )$ using\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\psi_0 }{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{c_g \\cdot \\nabla }\\psi_0 = S_{i}\n",
    "+ S_{nl} + S_{d}$$ where $\\psi_0 = \\psi _0 (f, \\theta ; \\mathbf{x},t)$\n",
    "varies in space ($\\mathbf x$) and time $t$, $S_{i}$ is input from the\n",
    "wind given by the Phillips (1957) and Miles (1957) mechanisms, $S_{nl}$\n",
    "is the transfer among wave components due to nonlinear interactions, and\n",
    "$S_{d}$ is dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third-generation wave-forecasting models now used by meteorological\n",
    "agencies throughout the world are based on integrations of (16.39) using\n",

    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">wamdi</span> Group, 1988; Komen et al, 1996). The forecasts\n",
    "follow individual components of the wave spectrum in space and time,\n",
    "allowing each component to grow or decay depending on local winds, and\n",
    "allowing wave components to interact according to Hasselmann’s theory.\n",
    "Typically the sea is represented by 300 components: 25 wavelengths going\n",
    "in 12 directions (30). To reduce computing time, the models use a nested\n",

    "## Measurement of Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Because waves influence so many processes and operations at sea, many\n",
    "techniques have been invented for measuring waves. Here are a few of the\n",
    "more commonly used. Stewart (1980) gives a more complete description of\n",
    "wave measurement techniques, including methods for measuring the\n",
    "directional distribution of waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sea State Estimated by Observers at Sea\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the most common observation included in early\n",
    "tabulations of wave heights. These are the significant wave heights\n",
    "summarized in the U.S. Navy’s *Marine Climatological Atlas* and other\n",
    "such reports printed before the age of satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Satellite Altimeters\n",
    "\n",
    "The satellite altimeters used to measure surface geostrophic currents\n",
    "also measure wave height. Altimeters were flown on Seasat in 1978,\n",
    "Geosat from 1985 to 1988, <span class=\"smallcaps\">ers–1 &2</span> from 1991,\n",
    "Topex/Poseidon from 1992, and Jason from 2001. Altimeter data have been\n",
    "used to produce monthly mean maps of wave heights and the variability of\n",
    "wave energy density in time and space. The next step, just begun, is to\n",
    "use altimeter observation with wave forecasting programs, to increase\n",
    "the accuracy of wave forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The altimeter technique works as follows. Radio pulse from a satellite\n",
    "altimeter reflect first from the wave crests, later from the wave\n",
    "troughs. The reflection stretches the altimeter pulse in time, and the\n",
    "stretching is measured and used to calculate wave height (figure 16.11).\n",
    "Accuracy is $\\pm 10$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 16.11 Shape of\n",
    "\n",
    "radio pulse received by the Seasat altimeter, showing the influence of\n",
    "ocean waves. The shape of the pulse is used to calculate significant\n",
    "wave height. After Stewart (1985: 264). <span id=\"fig:altimeterpulse\" label=\"fig:altimeterpulse\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Accelerometer Mounted on Meteorological or Other Buoy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a less common measurement, although it is often used for\n",
    "measuring waves during short experiments at sea. For example,\n",
    "accelerometers on weather ships measured wave height used by Pierson &\n",
    "Moskowitz and the waves shown in figure 16.2. The most accurate\n",
    "measurements are made using an accelerometer stabilized by a gyro so the\n",
    "axis of the accelerometer is always vertical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double integration of vertical acceleration gives displacement. The\n",
    "double integration, however, amplifies low-frequency noise, leading to\n",
    "the low frequency signals seen in figures 16.5 and 16.6. In addition,\n",
    "the buoy’s heave is not sensitive to wavelengths less than the buoy’s\n",
    "diameter, and buoys measure only waves having wavelengths greater than\n",
    "the diameter of the buoy. Overall, careful measurements are accurate to\n",
    "$\\pm \\,$<!-- -->10% or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wave Gages\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauges may be mounted on platforms or on the sea floor in shallow water.\n",
    "Many different types of sensors are used to measure the height of the\n",
    "wave or subsurface pressure which is related to wave height. Sound,\n",
    "infrared beams, and radio waves can be used to determine the distance\n",
    "from the sensor to the sea surface provided the sensor can be mounted on\n",
    "a stable platform that does not interfere with the waves. Pressure\n",
    "gauges described in §6.8 can be used to measure the depth from the sea\n",
    "surface to the gauge. Arrays of bottom-mounted pressure gauges are\n",
    "useful for determining wave directions. Thus arrays are widely used just\n",
    "offshore of the surf zone to determine offshore wave directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure gauge must be located within a quarter of a wavelength of the\n",
    "surface because wave-induced pressure fluctuations decrease\n",
    "exponentially with depth. Thus, both gauges and pressure sensors are\n",
    "restricted to shallow water or to large platforms on the continental\n",
    "shelf. Again, accuracy is $\\pm \\,$<!-- -->10% or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Synthetic Aperture Radars on Satellites\n",
    "\n",
    "These radars map the radar reflectivity of the sea surface with spatial\n",
    "resolution of 6–25 m. Maps of reflectivity often show wave-like\n",
    "features related to the real waves on the sea surface. I say ‘wave-like’\n",
    "because there is not an exact one-to-one relationship between wave\n",
    "height and image density. Some waves are clearly mapped, others less so.\n",
    "The maps, however, can be used to obtain additional information about\n",
    "waves, especially the spatial distribution of wave directions in shallow\n",
    "water (Vesecky and Stewart, 1982). Because the directional information\n",
    "can be calculated directly from the radar data without the need to\n",
    "calculate an image (Hasselmann, 1991), data from radars and altimeters\n",
    "on <span class=\"smallcaps\">ers</span>–1 & 2 are being used to determine if the radar and\n",
    "altimeter observations can be used directly in wave forecast programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Wavelength and frequency of waves are related through the dispersion\n",
    "    relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The velocity of a wave phase can differ from the velocity at which\n",
    "    wave energy propagates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Waves in deep water are dispersive, longer wavelengths travel faster\n",
    "    than shorter wavelengths. Waves in shallow water are not dispersive.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dispersion of ocean waves has been accurately measured, and\n",
    "    observations of dispersed waves can be used to track distant storms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The shape of the sea surface results from a linear superposition of\n",
    "    waves of all possible wavelengths or frequencies travelling in all\n",
    "    possible directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The spectrum gives the contributions by wavelength or frequency to\n",
    "    the variance of surface displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wave energy is proportional to variance of surface displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Digital spectra are band limited, and they contain no information\n",
    "    about waves with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Waves are generated by wind. Strong winds of long duration generate\n",
    "    the largest waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Various idealized forms of the wave spectrum generated by steady,\n",
    "    homogeneous winds have been proposed. Two important ones are the\n",
    "    Pierson-Moskowitz and <span class=\"smallcaps\">jonswap</span> spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Observations by mariners on ships and by satellite altimeters have\n",
    "    been used to make global maps of wave height. Wave gauges are used\n",
    "    on platforms in shallow water and on the continental shelf to\n",
    "    measure waves. Bottom-mounted pressure gauges are used to measure\n",
    "    waves just offshore of beaches. And synthetic-aperture radars are\n",
    "    used to obtain information about wave directions."
