<h1><span class="section-number">13. </span>Deep Circulation in the Ocean<a class="headerlink" href="#deep-circulation-in-the-ocean" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The direct forcing of the oceanic circulation by wind discussed in the
last few chapters is strongest in the upper kilometer of the water
column. Below a kilometer lies the vast water masses of the ocean
extending to depths of 4–5 km. The water is everywhere cold, with a
potential temperature less than 4C. The water mass is formed when cold,
dense water sinks from the surface to great depths at high latitudes. It
spreads out from these regions to fill the ocean basins. Deep mixing
eventually pulls the water up through the thermocline over large areas
of the ocean. It is this upward mixing that drives the deep circulation.
The vast deep ocean is usually referred to as the <em>abyss</em>, and the
circulation as the <em>abyssal circulation</em>.</p>
<p>The densest water at the sea surface, water that is dense enough to sink
to the bottom, is formed when frigid air blows across the ocean at high
latitudes in winter in the Atlantic between Norway and Greenland and
near Antarctica. The wind cools and evaporates water. If the wind is
cold enough, sea ice forms, further increasing the salinity of the water
because ice is fresher than sea water. Bottom water is produced only in
these two regions. Cold, dense water is formed in the North Pacific, but
it is not salty enough to sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>At mid and low latitudes, the density, even in winter, is sufficiently
low that the water cannot sink more than a few hundred meters into the
ocean. The only exception are some seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea,
where evaporation is so great that the salinity of the water is
sufficiently great for the water to sink to the bottom of these seas. If
these seas can exchange water with the open ocean, the waters formed in
winter in the seas mixes with the water in the open ocean and it spreads
out along intermediate depths in the open ocean.</p>
<section id="defining-the-deep-circulation">
<h2><span class="section-number">13.1. </span>Defining the Deep Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-the-deep-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Many terms have been used to describe the deep circulation. They
include: 1) <em>abyssal circulation</em>, 2) <em>thermohaline circulation</em> 3)
<em>meridional overturning circulation</em>, and 4) <em>global conveyor</em>. The term
thermohaline circulation was once widely used, but it has almost
entirely disappeared from the oceanographic literature (Toggweiler and
Russell, 2008). It is no longer used because it is now clear that the
flow is not density driven, and because the concept has not been clearly
defined (Wunsch, 2002b).</p>
<p>The meridional overturning circulation is better defined. It is the
zonal average of the flow plotted as a function of depth and latitude.
Plots of the circulation show where vertical flow is important, but they
show no information about how circulation in the gyres influences the
flow.</p>
<p>Following Wunsch (2002b), I define the deep circulation as the
circulation of mass. Of course, the mass circulation also carries heat,
salt, oxygen, and other properties. But the circulation of the other
properties is not the same as the mass transport. For example, Wunsch
points out that the north Atlantic imports heat but exports oxygen.</p>

<section id="importance-of-the-deep-circulation">
<h2><span class="section-number">13.2. </span>Importance of the Deep Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#importance-of-the-deep-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The deep circulation carries heat, salinity, oxygen, CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span>, and other
properties from high latitudes in winter to lower latitudes throughout
the world. This has very important consequences.</p>
<p>The contrast between the cold deep water and the warm surface waters
determines the stratification of the ocean, which strongly influences
ocean dynamics.</p>
<p>The volume of deep water is far larger than the volume of surface water.
Although currents in the deep ocean are relatively weak, they have
transports comparable to the surface transports.</p>
<p>The fluxes of heat and other variables carried by the deep circulation
influences earth’s heat budget and climate. The fluxes vary from decades
to centuries to millennia, and this variability modulates climate over
such time intervals. The ocean may be the primary cause of variability
over times ranging from years to decades, and it may have helped
modulate ice-age climate.</p>
<p>Two aspects of the deep circulation are especially important for
understanding earth’s climate and its possible response to increased
carbon dioxide CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> in the atmosphere: i) the ability of cold water to
store CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> and heat absorbed from the atmosphere, and ii) the ability
of deep currents to modulate the heat transported from the tropics to

<p>The ocean are the primary reservoir of readily available CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span>, an
important greenhouse gas. The ocean contain 40,000 GtC of dissolved,
particulate, and living forms of carbon. The land contains 2,200 GtC,
and the atmosphere contains only 750 GtC. Thus the ocean hold 50 times
more carbon than the air. Furthermore, the amount of new carbon put into
the atmosphere since the industrial revolution, 150 GtC, is less than
the amount of carbon cycled through the marine ecosystem in five years.
(1 GtC = 1 gigaton of carbon = <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{12}\)</span> kilograms of carbon.) Carbonate
rocks such as limestone, the shells of marine animals, and coral are
other, much larger, reservoirs. But this carbon is locked up. It cannot
be easily exchanged with carbon in other reservoirs.</p>
<p>More CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> dissolves in cold water than in warm water. Just imagine
shaking and opening a hot can of
Coke<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{\mbox{\textsf{\scriptsize TM}}}\)</span>. The CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> from a hot can will
spew out far faster than from a cold can. Thus the cold deep water in
the ocean is the major reservoir of dissolved CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> in the ocean.</p>
<p>New CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_ 2\)</span> is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and trees
are burned. Very quickly, 48% of the CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> released into the atmosphere
dissolves into the ocean (Sabine et al, 2004), much of which ends up
deep in the ocean.</p>
<p>Forecasts of future climate change depend strongly on how much CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> is
stored in the ocean and for how long. If little is stored, or if it is
stored and later released into the atmosphere, the concentration in the
atmosphere will change, modulating earth’s long-wave radiation balance.
How much and how long CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> is stored in the ocean depends on the
transport of CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> by the deep circulation and on the net flux of
carbon deposited on the sea floor. The amount that dissolves depends on
the temperature of the deep water, the storage time in the deep ocean
depends on the rate at which deep water is replenished, and the
deposition depends on whether the dead plants and animals that drop to
the sea floor are oxidized. Increased ventilation of deep layers, and
warming of the deep layers could release large quantities of the gas to
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The storage of carbon in the ocean also depends on the dynamics of
marine ecosystems, upwelling, and the amount of dead plants and animals
stored in sediments. But I won’t consider these processes.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">13.2.2. </span>Oceanic Transport of Heat<a class="headerlink" href="#oceanic-transport-of-heat" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The ocean carry about half the heat out of the tropics needed to
maintain earth’s temperature. Heat carried by the Gulf Stream and the
north Atlantic drift keeps the far north Atlantic ice free, and it helps
warm Europe. Norway, at 60N is far warmer than southern Greenland or
northern Labrador at the same latitude. Palm trees grow on the west
coast of Ireland, but not in Newfoundland which is further south.</p>
<p>Wally Broecker (1987), working at Lamont-Doherty Geophysical Observatory
of Columbia University, calls the oceanic component of the
heat-transport system the <em>Global Conveyor Belt</em>. The basic idea is that
surface currents carry heat to the far north Atlantic (figure 13.1).
There the surface water releases heat and water to the atmosphere, and
it becomes sufficiently cold, salty, and dense that it sinks to the
bottom in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. It then flows southward in
cold, bottom currents. Some of the water remains on the surface and
returns to the south in cool surface currents such as the Labrador
Current and Portugal Current (see figure 11.8). Richardson (2008) has
written a very useful paper surveying our understanding of the global
conveyor belt.</p>
<p>The deep bottom water from the north Atlantic is mixed upward in other
regions and ocean, and eventually it makes its way back to the Gulf
Stream and the North Atlantic. Thus most of the water that sinks in the
north Atlantic must be replaced by water from the far south Atlantic. As
this surface water moves northward across the equator and eventually
into the Gulf Stream, it carries heat out of the south Atlantic.</p>
<p>So much heat is pulled northward by the formation of north Atlantic
bottom water in winter that heat transport in the Atlantic is entirely
northward, even in the southern hemisphere (figure 5.11). Much of the
solar heat absorbed by the tropical Atlantic is shipped north to warm
Europe and the northern hemisphere. Imagine then what might happen if
the supply of heat is shut off. I will get back to that topic in the
next section.</p>
<p>Figure 13.1 The surface (narrow dashes)</p>
<p>and deep (wide dashes) currents in the north Atlantic. The North
Atlantic Current brings warm water northward where it cools. Some sinks
and returns southward as a cold, deep, western-boundary current. Some
returns southward at the surface. From Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. <span id="fig:fig13-1" label="fig:fig13-1"></span></p>
<p>We can make a crude estimate of the importance of the north Atlantic
surface and deep circulation from a calculation based on what we know
about waters in the Atlantic compiled by Bill Schmitz (1996) in his
wonderful summary of his life’s work. The Gulf Stream carries 40 Sv of
18C water northward. Of this, 14 Sv return southward in the deep western
boundary current at a temperature of 2C. The water must therefore lose
0.9 petawatts (1 petawatt <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= 10^{15}\)</span> watt) in the north Atlantic north
of 24N. Although the calculation is very crude, it is remarkably close
to the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.2\,\pm\,0.2\)</span> petawatts estimated much more carefully
by Rintoul and Wunsch (1991).</p>
<p>Note that if the water remained on the surface and returned as an
eastern boundary current, it would be far warmer than the deep current
when it returned southward. Hence, the heat transport would be much
reduced and it would probably not keep the far north Atlantic ice free.</p>
<p>The production of bottom water is influenced by the surface salinity and
winds in the north Atlantic (Toggweiler and Russell, 2008). It is also
influenced by the rate of upwelling due to mixing in other oceanic
areas. First, let’s look at the influence of salinity.</p>
<p>Saltier surface waters form denser water in winter than less salty
water. At first you may think that temperature is also important, but at
high latitudes water in all ocean basins gets cold enough to freeze, so
all ocean produce <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-2\)</span>C water at the surface. Of this, only the most
salty will sink, and the saltiest water is in the Atlantic and under the
ice on the continental shelves around Antarctica.</p>
<p>The production of bottom water is remarkably sensitive to small changes
in salinity. Rahmstorf (1995), using a numerical model of the meridional
overturning circulation, showed that a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->0.1Sv
variation of the flow of fresh water into the north Atlantic can switch
on or off the deep circulation of 14 Sv. If the deep-water production is
shut off during times of low salinity, the 1 petawatt of heat may also
be shut off. Weaver and Hillaire-Marcel (2004) point out that the
shutdown of the production of bottom water is unlikely, and if it did
happen, it would lead to a colder Europe, not a new ice age, because of
the higher concentrations of CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> now in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I write <em>may be shut off</em> because the ocean is a very complex system. We
don’t know if other processes will increase heat transport if the deep
circulation is disturbed. For example, the circulation at intermediate
depths may increase when deep circulation is reduced.</p>
<p>The production of bottom water is also remarkably sensitive to small
changes in mixing in the deep ocean. Munk and Wunsch (1998) calculate
that 2.1 TW (terawatts <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= 10^{12}\)</span> watts) are required to drive the deep
circulation, and that this small source of mechanical mixing drives a
poleward heat flux of 2000 TW. Some of the energy for mixing comes from
winds which can produce turbulent mixing throughout the ocean. Some
energy comes from the dissipation of tidal currents, which depend on the
distribution of the continents. Some of the energy comes from the flow
of deep water past the mid-ocean ridge system. Thus during the last ice
age, when sea level was much lower, tides, tidal currents, tidal
dissipation, winds, and deep circulation all differed from present
values.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">13.2.3. </span>Role of the Ocean in Ice-Age Climate Fluctuations<a class="headerlink" href="#role-of-the-ocean-in-ice-age-climate-fluctuations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>What might happen if the production of deep water in the Atlantic is
shut off? Information contained in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets,
in north Atlantic sediments, and in lake sediments provide important
clues.</p>
<p>Several ice cores through the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets provide
a continuous record of atmospheric conditions over Greenland and
Antarctica extending back more than 700,000 years before the present in
some cores. Annual layers in the core are counted to get age. Deeper in
the core, where annual layers are hard to see, age is calculated from
depth and from dust layers from well-dated volcanic eruptions.
Oxygen-isotope ratios of the ice give air temperature at the glacier
surface when the ice was formed. Deuterium concentrations give
ocean-surface temperature at the moisture source region. Bubbles in the
ice give atmospheric CO<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_2\)</span> and methane concentration. Pollen, chemical
composition, and particles give information about volcanic eruptions,
wind speed, and direction. Thickness of annual layers gives snow
accumulation rates. And isotopes of some elements give solar and cosmic
ray activity (Alley, 2000).</p>
<p>Cores through deep-sea sediments in the north Atlantic made by the Ocean
Drilling Program give information about i) surface and deep temperatures
and salinity at the location of above the core, ii) the production of
north Atlantic deep water, iii) ice volume in glaciers, and iv)
production of icebergs. Ice-sheet and deep-sea cores have allowed
reconstructions of climate for the past few hundred thousand years.</p>
<p>The oxygen-isotope and deuterium records in the ice cores show abrupt
climate variability many times over the past 700,000 years. Many times
during the last ice age temperatures near Greenland warmed rapidly over
periods of 1–100 years, followed by gradual cooling over longer
periods. (Dansgaard et al, 1993). For example, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 11,500\)</span> years
ago, temperatures over Greenland warmed by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 8\)</span>C in 40 years in
three steps, each spanning 5 years (Alley, 2000). Such abrupt warming is
called a Dansgaard/Oeschger event. Other studies have shown that much of
the northern hemisphere warmed and cooled in phase with temperatures
calculated from the ice core.</p>
<p>The climate of the past 8,000 years was constant with very little
variability. Our perception of climate change is thus based on highly
unusual circumstances. All of recorded history has been during a period
of warm and stable climate.</p>
<p>Hartmut Heinrich and colleagues (Bond et al. 1992), studying the
sediments in the north Atlantic found periods when coarse material was
deposited on the bottom in mid ocean. Only icebergs can carry such
material out to sea, and the find indicated times when large numbers of
icebergs were released into the north Atlantic. These are now called
Heinrich events.</p>
<p>Figure 13.2 Periodic</p>
<p>surges of icebergs during the last ice age appear to have modulated
temperatures of the northern hemisphere by lowering the salinity of the
far north Atlantic and reducing the meridional overturning circulation.
Data from cores through the Greenland ice sheet (1), deep-sea sediments
(2,3), and alpine-lake sediments (4) indicate that: <strong>Left:</strong> During
recent times the circulation has been stable, and the polar front which
separates warm and cold water masses has allowed warm water to penetrate
beyond Norway. <strong>Center:</strong> During the last ice age, periodic surges of
icebergs reduced salinity and reduced the meridional overturning
circulation, causing the polar front to move southward and keeping warm
water south of Spain. <strong>Right:</strong> Similar fluctuations during the last
interglacial appear to have caused rapid, large changes in climate. The
<strong>Bottom</strong> plot is a rough indication of temperature in the region, but
the scales are not the same. After Zahn (1994). <span id="fig:NAiceage" label="fig:NAiceage"></span></p>
<p>Figure 13.3 The</p>
<p>meridional-overturning circulation in the north Atlantic may be stable
near <em>2</em> and <em>4</em>. But, the switching from a warm, salty regime to a
cold, fresh regime and back has hysteresis. This means that as the warm
salty ocean in an initial state <em>1</em> freshens, and becomes more fresh
than <em>2</em> it quickly switches to a cold, fresh state <em>3</em>. When the area
again becomes salty, it must move past state <em>4</em> before it can switch
back to <em>1</em>. <span id="fig:hysteresis" label="fig:hysteresis"></span></p>
<p>The correlation of Greenland temperature with iceberg production is
related to the deep circulation. When icebergs melted, the surge of
fresh water increased the stability of the water column shutting off the
production of north Atlantic Deep Water. The shut-off of deep-water
formation greatly reduced the northward transport of warm water into the
north Atlantic, producing very cold northern hemisphere climate (figure
13.2). The melting of the ice pushed the polar front, the boundary
between cold and warm water in the north Atlantic further south than its
present position. The location of the front, and the time it was at
different positions can be determined from analysis of bottom sediments.</p>
<p>When the meridional overturning circulation shuts down, heat normally
carried from the south Atlantic to the north Atlantic becomes available
to warm the southern hemisphere. This results in a climate ‘sea-saw’
between northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<p>The switching on and off of the deep circulation has large hysteresis
(figure 13.3). The circulation has two stable states. The first is the
present circulation. In the second, deep water is produced mostly near
Antarctica, and upwelling occurs in the far north Pacific (as it does
today) and in the far north Atlantic. Once the circulation is shut off,
the system switches to the second stable state. The return to normal
salinity does not cause the circulation to turn on. Surface waters must
become saltier than average for the first state to return (Rahmstorf,
1995).</p>
<p>Heinrich events seem to precede the largest Dansgaard/Oeschger events
(Stocker and Marchal, 2000). Here’s what seems to happen. The Heinrich
event shuts off the Atlantic deep circulation which leads to a very cold
north Atlantic (Martrat et al, 2007). This is followed about 1000 years
later by a Dansgaard/Oeschger event with rapid warming.</p>
<p>Dansgaard/Oeschger–Heinrich tandem events have global influence, and
they are related to warming events seen in Antarctic ice cores.
Temperatures changes in the two hemispheres are out of phase. When
Greenland warms, Antarctica cools. Recent data from the European Project
for Ice Coring in Antarctica (<span class="smallcaps">epica</span>) shows that in the
period between 20,000 and 90,000 years ago, 40% of the variance in the
Greenland temperature data can be explained by Antarctic temperature
data (Steig, 2006).</p>
<p>A weakened version of this process with a period of about 1000 years may
be modulating present-day climate in the north Atlantic, and it may have
been responsible for the Little Ice Age from 1100 to 1800.</p>
<p>The relationship between variations in salinity, air temperature,
deep-water formation, and the atmospheric circulation is not yet
understood. For example, we don’t know if changes in the atmospheric
circulation trigger changes in the meridional overturning circulation,
or if changes in the meridional overturning circulation trigger changes
in the atmospheric circulation (Brauer et al, 2008). Furthermore, surges
may result from warmer temperatures caused by increased water vapor from
the tropics (a greenhouse gas) or from an internal instability of a
large ice sheet. We do know, however, that climate can change very
abruptly, and that circulation in the northern hemisphere has a very
sensitive threshold, that when crossed, causes large changes in the
circulation pattern.</p>
<p>For example, Steffensen (2008) found that 11,704, 12,896, and 14,694
years before 2000 <span class="smallcaps">ad</span> the temperature of the source water
for Greenland precipitation warmed 2–4C in 1–3 years. This indicates a
very rapid reorganization of the atmospheric circulation at high
latitudes in the northern hemisphere and a shift in the location of the
source region. During the earliest event air temperature over Greenland
warmed by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx\)</span> 10C in 3 years. At the later events, air temperature
over Greenland changed more slowly, over 60 to 200 years. Brauer et al
(2008) found an abrupt change in storminess over Germany at almost
exactly the same time, 12,679 years ago.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">13.3. </span>Theory for the Deep Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#theory-for-the-deep-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Stommel, Arons, and Faller in a series of papers from 1958 to 1960
described a simple theory of the abyssal circulation (Stommel 1958;
Stommel, Arons, and Faller, 1958; Stommel and Arons, 1960). The theory
differed so greatly from what was expected that Stommel and Arons
devised laboratory experiments with rotating fluids to confirmed their
theory. The theory for the deep circulation has been further discussed
by Marotzke (2000) and Munk and Wunsch (1998).</p>
<p>The Stommel, Arons, Faller theory is based on three fundamental ideas:</p>
<p>Cold, deep water is supplied by deep convection at a few high-latitude
locations in the Atlantic, notably in the Irminger and Greenland Seas in
the north and the Weddell Sea in the south.</p>
<p>Uniform mixing in the ocean brings the cold, deep water back to the
surface.</p>
<p>The deep circulation is strictly geostrophic in the interior of the
ocean, and therefore potential vorticity is conserved.</p>
<p>Notice that the deep circulation is driven by mixing, not by the sinking
of cold water at high latitudes. Munk and Wunsch (1998) point out that
deep convection by itself leads to a deep, stagnant, pool of cold water.
In this case, the deep circulation is confined to the upper layers of
the ocean. Mixing or upwelling is required to pump cold water upward
through the thermocline and drive the deep circulation. Winds and tides
are the primary source of energy driving the mixing.</p>
<p>Notice also that convection and sinking are not the same, and they do
not occur in the same place (Marotzke and Scott, 1999). Convection
occurs in small regions a few kilometers on a side. Sinking, driven by
Ekman pumping and geostrophic currents, can occur over far larger areas.
In this chapter, we are discussing mostly sinking of water.</p>
<p>To describe the simplest aspects of the flow, we begin with the Sverdrup
equation applied to a bottom current of thickness <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> in an ocean of
constant depth: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\,v =f\,\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{z}}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>f =2,\Omega,\sin \varphi<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(,

rotation rate, \)</span>R<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( earth’s radius, and \)</span>\varphi<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is latitude.
Integrating (13.1) from the bottom of the ocean to the top of the

<p>Figure 13.4 Idealized sketch of</p>
<p>the deep circulation due to deep convection in the Atlantic (dark
circles) and upwelling through the thermocline elsewhere. The real
circulation is much different than the circulation shown in this sketch.
After Stommel (1958).</p>
<p><span id="fig:stommeldeep" label="fig:stommeldeep"></span></p>
<p>To connect the streamlines of the flow in the west, Stommel added a deep
western boundary current. The strength of the western boundary current
depends on the volume of water <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> produced at the source regions.</p>
<p>Stommel and Arons calculated the flow for a simplified ocean bounded by
the Equator and two meridians (a pie shaped ocean). First they placed
the source <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_0\)</span> near the pole to approximate the flow in the north
Atlantic. If the volume of water sinking at the source equals the volume
of water upwelled in the basin, and if the upwelled velocity is constant
everywhere, then the transport <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_w\)</span> in the western boundary current is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_w = -2\,S_0 \sin \varphi\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The transport in the western boundary
current at the poles is twice the volume of the source, and the
transport diminishes to zero at the Equator (Stommel and Arons, 1960a:
eq, 7.3.15; see also Pedlosky, 1996: §7.3). The flow driven by the
upwelling water adds a recirculation equal to the source. If \)</span>S_0$
exceeds the volume of water upwelled in the basin, then the western
boundary current carries water across the Equator. This gives the
western boundary current sketched in the north Atlantic in figure 13.4.</p>
<p>Next, Stommel and Arons calculated the transport in a western boundary
current in a basin with no source. The transport is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_w = S \left[ 1 - 2 \, \sin \varphi \right]\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>S$ is the
transport across the Equator from the other hemisphere. In this basin
Stommel notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A current of recirculated water equal to the source strength starts at
the pole and flows toward the source <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ldots\)</span> [and] gradually
diminishes to zero at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi = 30\)</span>north latitude. A northward
current of equal strength starts at the equatorial source and also
diminishes to zero at 30north latitude.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This gives the western boundary current as sketched in the north Pacific
in figure 13.4.</p>
<p>Figure 13.5 Deep flow</p>
<p>in the Indian Ocean inferred from the temperature, given in C. Note that
the flow is constrained by the deep mid-ocean ridge system. After
Tchernia (1980). <span id="fig:deepindian" label="fig:deepindian"></span></p>
<p>Note that the Stommel-Arons theory assumes a flat bottom. The mid-ocean
ridge system divides the deep ocean into a series of basins connected by
sills through which the water flows from one basin to the next. As a
result, the flow in the deep ocean is not as simple as that sketched by
Stommel. Boundary current flow along the edges of the basins, and flow
in the eastern basins in the Atlantic comes through the mid-Atlantic
ridge from the western basics. Figure 13.5 shows how ridges control the
flow in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Finally, Stommel-Arons theory gives some values for time required for
water to move from the source regions to the base of the thermocline in
various basins. The time varies from a few hundred years for basins near
the sources to nearly a thousand years for the north Pacific, which is
farther from the sources.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">13.3.1. </span>Some Comments on the Theory for the Deep Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#some-comments-on-the-theory-for-the-deep-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Our understanding of the deep circulation is still evolving.</p>
<p>Marotzke and Scott (1999) points out that deep convection and mixing are
very different processes. Convection reduces the potential energy of the
water column, and it is self powered. Mixing in a stratified fluid
increases the potential energy, and it must be driven by an external
process.</p>
<p>Numerical models show that the deep circulation is very sensitive to the
assumed value of vertical eddy diffusivity in the thermocline (Gargett
and Holloway, 1992).</p>
<p>Numerical calculations by Marotzke and Scott (1999) indicate that the
mass transport is not limited by the rate of deep convection, but it is
sensitive to the assumed value of vertical eddy diffusivity, especially
near side boundaries.</p>
<p>Cold water is mixed upward at the ocean’s boundaries, above seamounts
and mid-ocean ridges, along strong currents such as the Gulf Stream, and
in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Toggweiler and Russell, 2008;
Garabato et al, 2004, 2007). Because mixing is strong over mid-ocean
ridges and small in nearby areas, flow is zonal in the ocean basins and
poleward along the ridges (Hogg et al. 2001). A map of the circulation
will not look like figure 13.4. Numerical models and measurements of
deep flow by floats show the flow is indeed zonal.</p>
<p>Because the transport of mass, heat, and salt are not closely related
the transport of heat into the north Atlantic may not be as sensitive to
surface salinity as described above.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">13.4. </span>Observations of the Deep Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#observations-of-the-deep-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The abyssal circulation is less well known than the upper-ocean
circulation. Direct observations from moored current meters or
deep-drifting floats were difficult to make until recently, and there
are few long-term direct measurements of current. In addition, the
measurements do not produce a stable mean value for the deep currents.
For example, if the deep circulation takes roughly 1,000 years to
transport water from the north Atlantic to the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current and then to the north Pacific, the mean flow is about 1 mm/s.
Observing this small mean flow in the presence of typical deep currents
having variable velocities of up to 10 cm/s or greater, is very
difficult.</p>
<p>Most of our knowledge of the deep circulation is inferred from measured
distribution of water masses with their distinctive temperature and
salinity and their concentrations of oxygen, silicate, tritium,
fluorocarbons and other tracers. These measurements are much more stable
than direct current measurements, and observations made decades apart
can be used to trace the circulation. Tomczak (1999) carefully describes
how the techniques can be made quantitative and how they can be applied
in practice.</p>
<section id="water-masses">
<h3><span class="section-number">13.4.1. </span>Water Masses<a class="headerlink" href="#water-masses" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The concept of water masses originates in meteorology. Vilhelm Bjerknes,
a Norwegian meteorologist, first described the cold air masses that form
in the polar regions. He showed how they move southward, where they
collide with warm air masses at places he called fronts, just as masses
of troops collide at fronts in war (Friedman, 1989). In a similar way,
water masses are formed in different regions of the ocean, and the water
masses are often separated by fronts. Note, however, that strong winds
are associated with fronts in the atmosphere because of the large
difference in density and temperature on either side of the front.
Fronts in the ocean sometimes have little contrast in density, and these
fronts have only weak currents.</p>

<div><p>body of water with a common formation history, having its origin in a
physical region of the ocean. Just as air masses in the atmosphere,
water masses are physical entities with a measurable volume and
therefore occupy a finite volume in the ocean. In their formation
region they have exclusive occupation of a particular part of the
ocean. Elsewhere they share the ocean with other water masses with
which they mix. The total volume of a water mass is given by the sum
of all its elements regardless of their location.</p>

Gulf Stream. Data are from tables 10.2 and 10.4. <strong>Left:</strong> Temperature
and salinity plotted as a function of depth. <strong>Right:</strong> The same data,
but salinity is plotted as a function of temperature in a <em>T-S</em> plot.
Notice that temperature and salinity are uniquely related below the
mixed layer. A few depths are noted next to data points.
<span id="fig:GulfStreamTSDPlot" label="fig:GulfStreamTSDPlot"></span></p>
<p>Plots of salinity as a function of temperature, called <em>T-S</em> plots, are
used to delineate water masses and their geographical distribution, to
describe mixing among water masses, and to infer motion of water in the
deep ocean. Here’s why the plots are so useful: water properties, such
as temperature and salinity, are formed only when the water is at the
surface or in the mixed layer. Heating, cooling, rain, and evaporation
all contribute. Once the water sinks below the mixed layer temperature
and salinity can change only by mixing with adjacent water masses. Thus
water from a particular region has a particular temperature associated
with a particular salinity, and the relationship changes little as the
water moves through the deep ocean.</p>
<p>Thus temperature and salinity are not independent variables. For
example, the temperature and salinity of the water at different depths
below the Gulf Stream are uniquely related (figure 13.6, right),
indicating they came from the same source region, even though they do
not appear related if temperature and salinity are plotted independently
as a function of depth (figure 13.6, left).</p>
<p>Temperature and salinity are <em>conservative properties</em> because there are
no sources or sinks of heat and salt in the interior of the ocean. Other
properties, such as oxygen are non-conservative. For example, oxygen
content may change slowly due to oxidation of organic material and
respiration by animals.</p>
<p>Each point in the <em>T-S</em> plot is a <em>water type</em>. This is a mathematical
ideal. Some water masses may be very homogeneous and they are almost
points on the plot. Other water masses are less homogeneous, and they
occupy regions on the plot.</p>
<p>Figure 13.7 <strong>Upper:</strong> Mixing</p>
<p>of two water masses produces a line on a <em>T-S</em> plot. <strong>Lower:</strong> Mixing
among three water masses produces intersecting lines on a <em>T-S</em> plot,
and the apex at the intersection is rounded by further mixing. After
Defant (1961: 205). <span id="fig:TSsketch" label="fig:TSsketch"></span></p>
<p>Mixing two water types leads to a straight line on a <em>T-S</em> diagram
(figure 13.7). Because the lines of constant density on a <em>T-S</em> plot are
curved, mixing increases the density of the water. This is called
<em>densification</em> (figure 13.8).</p>

<p>Let’s use these ideas of water masses and mixing to study the deep
circulation. We start in the south Atlantic because it has very clearly
defined water masses. A <em>T-S</em> plot calculated from hydrographic data
collected in the south Atlantic (figure 13.9) shows three important
water masses listed in order of decreasing depth (table 13.1): Antarctic
Bottom Water <span class="smallcaps">aab</span>, North Atlantic Deep Water
<span class="smallcaps">nadw</span>, and Antarctic Intermediate Water <span class="smallcaps">aiw</span>.
All are deeper than one kilometer. The mixing among three water masses
shows the characteristic rounded apexes shown in the idealized case
shown in figure 13.7.</p>
<p>The plot indicates that the same water masses can be found throughout
the western basins in the south Atlantic. Now let’s use a cross section
of salinity to trace the movement of the water masses using the core
method.</p>

<p>The slow variation from place to place in the ocean of a tracer such as
salinity can be used to determine the source of the waters masses such
as those in figure 13.9. This is called the <em>core method</em>. The method
may also be used to track the slow movement of the water mass. Note,
however, that a slow drift of the water and horizontal mixing both
produce the same observed properties in the plot, and they cannot be

<p>A <em>core</em> is a layer of water with extreme value (in the mathematical
sense) of salinity or other property as a function of depth. An extreme
value is a local maximum or minimum of the quantity as a function of
depth. The method assumes that the flow is along the core. Water in the
core mixes with the water masses above and below the core and it
gradually loses its identity. Furthermore, the flow tends to be along
surfaces of constant potential density.</p>
<p>Let’s apply the method to the data from the south Atlantic to find the
source of the water masses. As you might expect, this will explain their
names.</p>
<p>We start with a north-south cross section of salinity in the western
basins of the Atlantic (figure 13.10). It we locate the maxima and
minima of salinity as a function of depth at different latitudes, we can
see two clearly defined cores. The upper low-salinity core starts near
55S and it extends northward at depths near 1000 m. This water
originates at the Antarctic Polar Front zone. This is the Antarctic
Intermediate Water. Below this water mass is a core of salty water
originating in the far north Atlantic. This is the North Atlantic Deep
Water. Below this is the most dense water, the Antarctic Bottom Water.
It originates in winter when cold, dense, saline water forms in the
Weddell Sea and other shallow seas around Antarctica. The water sinks
along the continental slope and mixes with Circumpolar Deep Water. It
then fills the deep basins of the south Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian
ocean.</p>
<p>Figure 13.10 Contour</p>
<p>plot of salinity as a function of depth in the western basins of the
Atlantic from the Arctic Ocean to Antarctica. The plot clearly shows
extensive cores, one at depths near 1000 m extending from 50S to 20N,
the other at is at depths near 2000 m extending from 20N to 50S. The
upper is the Antarctic Intermediate Water, the lower is the North
Atlantic Deep Water. The arrows mark the assumed direction of the flow
in the cores. The Antarctic Bottom Water fills the deepest levels from
50S to 30N. <span class="smallcaps">pf</span> is the polar front, <span class="smallcaps">saf</span> is
the subantarctic front. See also figures 10.15 and 6.10. After Lynn and
Reid (1968). <span id="fig:Cores" label="fig:Cores"></span></p>
<p>The Circumpolar Deep Water is mostly North Atlantic Deep Water that has
been carried around Antarctica. As it is carried along, it mixes with
deep waters of the Indian and Pacific Ocean to form the circumpolar
water.</p>
<p>The flow is probably not along the arrows shown in figure 13.10. The
distribution of properties in the abyss can be explained by a
combination of slow flow in the direction of the arrows plus horizontal
mixing along surfaces of constant potential density with some weak
vertical mixing. The vertical mixing probably occurs at the places where
the density surface reaches the sea bottom at a lateral boundary such as
seamounts, mid-ocean ridges, and along the western boundary. Flow in a
plane perpendicular to that of the figure may be at least as strong as
the flow in the plane of the figure shown by the arrows.</p>
<p>The core method can be applied only to a tracer that does not influence
density. Hence temperature is usually a poor choice. If the tracer
controls density, then flow will be around the core according to ideas
of geostrophy, not along core as assumed by the core method.</p>
<p>The core method works especially well in the south Atlantic with its
clearly defined water masses. In other ocean basins, the <em>T-S</em>
relationship is more complicated. The abyssal waters in the other basins
are a complex mixture of waters coming from different areas in the ocean
(figure 13.11). For example, warm, salty water from the Mediterranean
Sea enters the north Atlantic and spreads out at intermediate depths
displacing intermediate water from Antarctica in the north Atlantic,
adding additional complexity to the flow as seen in the lower right part
of the figure.</p>

<p>I have illustrated the core method using salinity as a tracer, but many
other tracers are used. An ideal tracer is easy to measure even when its
concentration is very small; it is conserved, which means that only
mixing changes its concentration; it does not influence the density of
the water; it exists in the water mass we wish to trace, but not in
other adjacent water masses; and it does not influence marine organisms
(we don’t want to release toxic tracers).</p>
<p>Various tracers meet these criteria to a greater or lesser extent, and
they are used to follow the deep and intermediate water in the ocean.
Here are some of the most widely used tracers.</p>
<p>Salinity is conserved, and it influences density much less than
temperature.</p>
<p>Oxygen is only partly conserved. Its concentration is reduced by the
respiration by marine plants and animals and by oxidation of organic
carbon.</p>
<p>Silicates are used by some marine organisms. They are conserved at
depths below the sunlit zone.</p>
<p>Phosphates are used by all organisms, but they can provide additional
information.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>He is conserved, but there are few sources, mostly at deep-sea
volcanic areas and hot springs.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>H (tritium) was produced by atomic bomb tests in the atmosphere in
the 1950s. It enters the ocean through the mixed layer, and it is useful
for tracing the formation of deep water. It decays with a half life of
12.3 y and it is slowly disappearing from the ocean. Figure 10.16 shows
the slow advection or perhaps mixing of the tracer into the deep north
Atlantic. Note that after 25 years little tritium is found south of
30 N. This implies a mean velocity of less than a mm/s.</p>
<p>Fluorocarbons (Freon used in air conditioning) have been recently
injected into atmosphere. They can be measured with very great
sensitivity, and they are being used for tracing the sources of deep
water.</p>
<p>Sulphur hexafluoride SF<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(_6\)</span> can be injected into sea water, and the
concentration can be measured with great sensitivity for many months.</p>
<p>Each tracer has its usefulness, and each provides additional information

measured through the Strait of Florida, and wind stress, which gives the
Ekman transports, was measured along 24N by satellite instruments. The
measurements show that transport across 24N was zero, within the
accuracy of the measurements, as expected. The one-year average of the

<h2><span class="section-number">13.5. </span>Antarctic Circumpolar Current<a class="headerlink" href="#antarctic-circumpolar-current" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is an important feature of the ocean’s
deep circulation because it transports deep and intermediate water
between the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean, and because Ekman
pumping driven by westerly winds is a major driver of the deep
circulation. Because it is so important for understanding the deep
circulation in all ocean, let’s look at what is known about this
current.</p>
<p>Figure 13.12 Cross</p>

<p>the transport in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as measured by an

<p><span id="fig:aacxport" label="fig:aacxport"></span></p>
<p>A plot of density across a line of constant longitude in the Drake
Passage (figure 13.12) shows three fronts. They are, from north to
south: 1) the Subantarctic Front, 2) the Polar Front, and 3) the
Southern <span class="smallcaps">acc</span> Front. Each front is continuous around
Antarctica (figure 13.13). The plot also shows that the constant-density
surfaces slope at all depths, which indicates that the currents extend
to the bottom.</p>
<p>Typical current speeds are around 10 cm/s with speeds of up to 50 cm/s
near some fronts. Although the currents are slow, they transport much
more water than western boundary currents because the flow is deep and
wide. Whitworth and Peterson (1985) calculated transport through the
Drake Passage using several years of data from an array of 91 current
meters on 24 moorings spaced approximately 50 km apart along a line
spanning the passage. They also used measurements of bottom pressure
measured by gauges on either side of the passage. They found that the
average transport through the Drake Passage was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(125 \pm 11\)</span> Sv, and
that the transport varied from 95 Sv to 158 Sv. The maximum transport
tended to occur in late winter and early spring (figure 13.14).</p>
<p>Because the antarctic currents reach the bottom, they are influenced by
topographic steering. As the current crosses ridges such as the
Kerguelen Plateau, the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, and the Drake Passage,
it is deflected by the ridges.</p>
<p>The core of the current is composed of Circumpolar Deep Water, a mixture
of deep water from all ocean. The upper branch of the current contains
oxygen-poor water from all ocean. The lower (deeper) branch contains a
core of high-salinity water from the Atlantic, including contributions
from the north Atlantic deep water mixed with salty Mediterranean Sea
water. As the different water masses circulate around Antarctica they
mix with other water masses with similar density. In a sense, the
current is a giant ‘mix-master’ taking deep water from each ocean,
mixing it with deep water from other ocean, and then redistributing it
back to each ocean (Garabato et al, 2007).</p>
<p>The coldest, saltiest water in the ocean is produced on the continental
shelf around Antarctica in winter, mostly from the shallow Weddell and
Ross seas. The cold salty water drains from the shelves, entrains some
deep water, and spreads out along the sea floor. Eventually, 8–10 Sv of
bottom water are formed (Orsi, Johnson, and Bullister, 1999). This dense
water then seeps into all the ocean basins. By definition, this water is
too dense to cross through the Drake Passage, so it is not circumpolar
water.</p>
<p>The Antarctic currents are wind driven. Strong west winds with maximum
speed near 50S drive the currents (see figure 4.2), and the north-south
gradient of wind speed produces convergence and divergence of Ekman
transports. Divergence south of the zone of maximum wind speed, south of
50S leads to upwelling of the Circumpolar Deep Water. Convergence north
of the zone of maximum winds leads to downwelling of the Antarctic
intermediate water. The surface water is relatively fresh but cold, and
when they sink they define characteristics of the Antarctic intermediate
water.</p>
<p>The position of the circumpolar current relative to the maximum of the
westerly winds influences the meridional overturning circulation and
climate. North of the maximum, Ekman transports converge, pushing water
downward into the Antarctic Intermediate Water north of the Polar Front.
South of the maximum winds, Ekman transports diverge, pulling
Circumpolar Atlantic Deep Water to the surface south of the Polar Front,
which helps drive the deep circulation (figure 13.10). When the maximum
winds are further from the pole, less deep water is pulled upward, and
the deep circulation is weak, as it was during the last ice age. As the
earth warmed after the ice age, the maximum winds shifted south. The
winds were more aligned with the Circumpolar Current, and they pulled
more deep water to the surface. Since 1960, the winds have strengthened
and shifted southward, further strengthening Circumpolar Current and the
deep circulation Toggweiler and Russell, 2008).</p>
<p>Because wind constantly transfers momentum to the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current, causing it to accelerate, the acceleration must be balanced by
drag, and we are led to ask: What keeps the flow from accelerating to
very high speeds? Munk and Palmen (1951), suggest form drag dominates.
Form drag is due to the current crossing sub-sea ridges, especially at
the Drake Passage. Form drag is also the drag of the wind on a fast
moving car. In both cases, the flow is diverted, by the ridge or by your
car, creating a low pressure zone downstream of the ridge or down wind
of the car. The low pressure zone transfers momentum into the solid
earth, slowing down the current.</p>

<p>The production of deep bottom waters in the north Atlantic draws a

<p>The deep circulation is driven by vertical mixing, which is largest

<p>The deep circulation is too weak to measure directly. It is inferred
