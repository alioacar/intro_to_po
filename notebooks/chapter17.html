<h1><span class="section-number">17. </span>Coastal Processes and Tides<a class="headerlink" href="#coastal-processes-and-tides" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>In the last chapter I described waves on the sea surface. Now we can
consider several special and important cases: the transformation of
waves as they come ashore and break; the currents and edge waves
generated by the interaction of waves with coasts; tsunamis; storm
surges; and tides, especially tides along coasts and in the deep ocean.</p>
<section id="shoaling-waves-and-coastal-processes">
<h2><span class="section-number">17.1. </span>Shoaling Waves and Coastal Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#shoaling-waves-and-coastal-processes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Wave phase and group velocities are a function of depth when the depth
is less than about one-quarter wavelength in deep water. Wave period and
frequency are invariant (don’t change as the wave comes ashore); and
this is used to compute the properties of shoaling waves. Wave height
increases as wave group velocity slows. Wave length decreases. Waves
change direction due to refraction. Finally, waves break if the water is
sufficiently shallow; and broken waves pour water into the surf zone,
creating long-shore and rip currents.</p>
<section id="shoaling-waves">
<h3><span class="section-number">17.1.1. </span>Shoaling Waves<a class="headerlink" href="#shoaling-waves" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The dispersion relation (16.3) is used to calculate wave properties as
the waves propagate from deep water offshore to shallow water just
outside the surf zone. Because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> is constant, (16.3) leads to:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{L}{L_{0}} = \frac{c}{c_{0}}=\frac{\sin \alpha }{\sin \alpha _{0}} = \tanh
\frac{2 \pi d}{L} \label{eq:intermed}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{0} = \frac{g T^{2}}{2 \pi }, \qquad c_{0} = \frac{g T}{2 \pi } \label{eq:Lzero}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
and \)</span>L<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is wave length, \)</span>c<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is phase velocity, \)</span>\alpha<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the angle of
the crest relative to contours of constant depth, and \)</span>d<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is water
depth. The subscript \)</span>0$ indicates values in deep water.</p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d/L\)</span> is calculated from the solution of
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{d}{L_{0}} = \frac{d}{L} \tanh \frac{2 \pi d}{L} \label{eq:intermediate}\)</span>$
using an iterative technique, or from figure 17.1, or from Wiegel (1964:
A1).</p>

<p>Figure 17.2 sub-sea</p>
<p>features, such as submarine canyons and ridges, offshore of coasts can
greatly influence the height of breakers inshore of the features. After
Thurman (1985: 229).</p>
<p><span id="wavefocusing" label="wavefocusing"></span></p>
<p>Because wave velocity is a function of depth in shallow water,
variations in offshore water depth can focus or defocus wave energy
reaching the shore. Consider the simple case of waves with deep-water
crests almost parallel to a straight beach with two ridges each
extending seaward from a headland (figure 17.2). Wave group velocity is
faster in the deeper water between the ridges, and the wave crests
become progressively deformed as the wave propagates toward the beach.
Wave energy, which propagates perpendicular to wave crests, is refracted
out of the region between the headland. As a result, wave energy is
focused into the headlands, and breakers there are much larger than
breakers in the bay. The difference in wave height can be surprisingly
large. On a calm day, breakers can be knee high shoreward of a submarine
canyon at La Jolla Shores, California, just south of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography. At the same time, waves just north of the

<p>As waves move into shallow water, the group velocity becomes small, wave
energy per square meter of sea surface increases, and non-linear terms
in the wave equations become important. These processes cause waves to
steepen, with short steep crests and broad shallow troughs. When wave
slope at the crest becomes sufficiently steep, the wave breaks (figure
17.3 Right). The shape of the breaking wave depends on the slope of the
bottom, and the steepness of waves offshore (figure 17.3 Left).</p>
<p>Steep waves tend to lose energy slowly as the waves moves into shallower
water through water spilling down the front of the wave. These are
spilling breakers.</p>
<p>Less steep waves on steep beaches tend to steepen so quickly that the
crest of the wave moves much faster than the trough, and the crest,
racing ahead of the trough, plunges into the trough (figure 17.4).</p>
<p>If the beach is sufficiently steep, the wave can surge up the face of
the beach without breaking in the sense that white water is formed. Or
if it is formed, it is at the leading edge of the water as it surges up
the beach. An extreme example would be a wave incident on a vertical
breakwater.</p>

<p>Waves break in a narrow band of shallow water along the beach, the <em>surf
zone</em>. After breaking, waves continues as a near-vertical wall of
turbulent water called a <em>bore</em> which carries water to the beach. At
first, the bore surges up the beach, then retreats. The water carried by
the bore is left in the shallow waters inside the breaker zone.</p>

<p>generated by water carried to the beach by breaking waves.</p>
<p><span id="fig:rips" label="fig:rips"></span></p>
<p>Water dumped inside the breaker zone must return offshore. It does this
by first moving parallel to the beach as an <em>along-shore current</em>. Then
it turns and flows offshore perpendicular to the beach in a narrow,
swift <em>rip current</em>. The rips are usually spaced hundreds of meters
apart (figure 17.5). Usually there is a band of deeper water between the
breaker zone and the beach, and the long-shore current runs in this
channel. The strength of a rip current depends on the height and
frequency of breaking waves and the strength of the onshore wind. Rips
are a danger to unwary swimmers, especially poor swimmers bobbing along
in the waves inside the breaker zone. They are carried along by the
along-shore current until they are suddenly carried out to sea by the
rip. Swimming against the rip is futile, but swimmers can escape by
swimming parallel to the beach.</p>
<p><em>Edge waves</em> are produced by the variability of wave energy reaching
shore. Waves tend to come in groups, especially when waves come from
distant storms. For several minutes breakers may be smaller than
average, then a few very large waves will break. The minute-to-minute
variation in the height of breakers produces low-frequency variability
in the along-shore current. This, in turn, drives a low-frequency wave
attached to the beach, an edge wave. The waves have periods of a few
minutes, a long-shore wave length of around a kilometer, and an
amplitude that decays exponentially offshore (figure 17.6).</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">17.2. </span>Tsunamis<a class="headerlink" href="#tsunamis" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Tsunamis are low-frequency ocean waves generated by submarine
earthquakes. The sudden motion of sea floor over distances of a hundred
or more kilometers generates waves with periods of 15–40 minutes
(figure 17.7). A quick calculation shows that such waves must be
shallow-water waves, propagating at a speed of 180 m/s and having a
wavelength of 130 km in water 3.6 km deep (figure 17.8). The waves are
not noticeable at sea, but after slowing on approach to the coast, and
after refraction by sub-sea features, they can come ashore and surge to
heights ten or more meters above sea level. In an extreme example, the
great 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami destroyed hundreds of villages, killing
at least 200,000 people.</p>

<p>Wave amplitudes are relatively large shoreward of submarine ridges. They
are relatively low shoreward of submarine valleys, provided the features

<p>Wave amplitudes are decreased by the presence of coral reefs bordering

<p>Waves can bend around circular islands without great loss of energy, but

measured earthquake magnitude and location to calculate vertical
displacement of the sea floor. The forcing is modified once waves are

<p>Storm winds blowing over shallow, continental shelves pile water against
the coast. The increase in sea level is known as a storm surge. Several
processes are important:</p>
<p>Ekman transport by winds parallel to the coast transports water toward
the coast causing a rise in sea level.</p>
<p>Winds blowing toward the coast push water directly toward the coast.</p>
<p>Wave run-up and other wave interactions transport water toward the coast
adding to the first two processes.</p>
<p>Edge waves generated by the wind travel along the coast.</p>
<p>The low pressure inside the storm raises sea level by one centimeter for
each millibar decrease in pressure through the inverted-barometer
effect.</p>
<p>Finally, the storm surge adds to the tides, and high tides can change a
relative weak surge into a much more dangerous one.</p>

<section id="theory-of-ocean-tides">
<h2><span class="section-number">17.4. </span>Theory of Ocean Tides<a class="headerlink" href="#theory-of-ocean-tides" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Tides have been so important for commerce and science for so many
thousands of years that tides have entered our everyday language: <em>time
and tide wait for no one</em>, <em>the ebb and flow of events</em>, <em>a high-water
mark</em>, and <em>turn the tide of battle</em>.</p>
<p>Tides produce strong currents in many parts of the ocean. Tidal currents
can have speeds of up to 5 m/s in coastal waters, impeding navigation
and mixing coastal waters.</p>
<p>Tidal currents generate internal waves over seamounts, continental
slopes, and mid-ocean ridges. The waves dissipate tidal energy. Breaking
internal waves and tidal currents are a major force driving oceanic
mixing.</p>
<p>Tidal mixing helps drive the deep circulation, and it influences climate
and abrupt climate change.</p>
<p>Tidal currents can suspend bottom sediments, even in the deep ocean.</p>
<p>Earth’s crust is elastic. It bends under the influence of the tidal
potential. It also bends under the weight of oceanic tides. As a result,
the sea floor, and the continents move up and down by about 10 cm in
response to the tides. The deformation of the solid earth influence
almost all precise geodetic measurements.</p>
<p>Oceanic tides lag behind the tide-generating potential. This produces
forces that transfer angular momentum between earth and the tide
producing body, especially the moon. As a result of tidal forces,
earth’s rotation about it’s axis slows, increasing the length of day;
the rotation of the moon about earth slows, causing the moon to move
slowly away from earth; and moon’s rotation about it’s axis slows,
causing the moon to keep the same side facing earth as the moon rotates
about earth.</p>
<p>Tides influence the orbits of satellites. Accurate knowledge of tides is
needed for computing the orbit of altimetric satellites and for
correcting altimeter measurements of oceanic topography.</p>
<p>Tidal forces on other planets and stars are important for understanding
many aspects of solar-system dynamics and even galactic dynamics. For
example, the rotation rate of Mercury, Venus, and Io result from tidal
forces.</p>
<p>Mariners have known for at least four thousand years that tides are
related to the phase of the moon. The exact relationship, however, is
hidden behind many complicating factors, and some of the greatest
scientific minds of the last four centuries worked to understand,
calculate, and predict tides. Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, Newton, Euler,
Bernoulli, Kant, Laplace, Airy, Lord Kelvin, Jeffreys, Munk and many
others contributed. Some of the first computers were developed to
compute and predict tides. Ferrel built a tide-predicting machine in
1880 that was used by the U.S. Coast Survey to predict nineteen tidal
constituents. In 1901, Harris extended the capacity to 37 constituents.</p>
<p>Despite all this work important questions remained: What is the
amplitude and phase of the tides at any place on the ocean or along the
coast? What is the speed and direction of tidal currents? What is the
shape of the tides on the ocean? Where is tidal energy dissipated?
Finding answers to these simple questions is difficult, and the first,
accurate, global maps of deep-sea tides were only published in 1994
(LeProvost et al. 1994). The problem is hard because the tides are a
self-gravitating, near-resonant, sloshing of water in a rotating,
elastic, ocean basin with ridges, mountains, and submarine basins.</p>
<p>Predicting tides along coasts and at ports is much easier. Data from a
tide gauge plus the theory of tidal forcing gives an accurate
description of tides near the tide gauge.</p>
<section id="tidal-potential">
<h3><span class="section-number">17.4.1. </span>Tidal Potential<a class="headerlink" href="#tidal-potential" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Tides are calculated from the hydrodynamic equations for a
self-gravitating ocean on a rotating, elastic earth. The driving force
is the gradient of the gravity field of the moon and sun. If the earth
were an ocean planet with no land, and if we ignore the influence of
inertia and currents, the gravity gradient produces a pair of bulges of
water on earth, one on the side facing the moon or sun, one on the side
away from the moon or sun. A clear derivation of the forces is given by
Pugh (1987) and by Dietrich, Kalle, Krauss, and Siedler (1980). Here I
follow the discussion in Pugh (1987: §3.2).</p>
<p>Note that many oceanographic books state that the tide is produced by
two processes: i) the centripetal acceleration at earth’s surface as the
earth and moon circle around a common center of mass, and ii) the
gravitational attraction of mass on earth and the moon. However, the
derivation of the tidal potential does not involve centripetal
acceleration, and the concept is not used by the astronomical or
geodetic communities.</p>

<p><span id="fig:tidesketch" label="fig:tidesketch"></span></p>
<p>To calculate the amplitude and phase of the tide on an ocean planet, we
begin by calculating the tide-generating potential. This is much easier
than calculating the forces. Ignoring for now earth’s rotation, the
rotation of moon about earth produces a potential <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_M\)</span> at any point on

(1980: 413).</p>
<p><span id="fig:horiztideforce" label="fig:horiztideforce"></span></p>
<p>The tide-generating force can be decomposed into components
perpendicular <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> and parallel <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> to the sea surface. Tides are
produced by the horizontal component. “The vertical component is
balanced by pressure on the sea bed, but the ratio of the horizontal
force per unit mass to vertical gravity has to be balanced by an
opposing slope of the sea surface, as well as by possible changes in
current momentum” (Cartwright, 1999: 39, 45). The horizontal component,
shown in figure 17.11, is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H = - \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial V}{\partial\varphi} = \frac{2 G}{r} \sin
2\varphi\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G = \frac{3}{4} \gamma M \left( \frac{r^{2}}{R^{3}} \right)\)</span>$ The
tidal potential is symmetric about the earth-moon line, and it produces
symmetric bulges.</p>
<p>If we allow our ocean-covered earth to rotate, an observer in space sees
the two bulges fixed relative to the earth-moon line as earth rotates.
To an observer on earth, the two tidal bulges seems to rotate around
earth because moon appears to move around the sky at nearly one cycle
per day. Moon produces high tides every 12 hours and 25.23 minutes on
the equator if the moon is above the equator. Notice that high tides are
not exactly twice per day because the moon is also rotating around
earth. Of course, the moon is above the equator only twice per lunar
month, and this complicates our simple picture of the tides on an ideal
ocean-covered earth. Furthermore, moon’s distance from earth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> varies
because moon’s orbit is elliptical and because the elliptical orbit is
not fixed.</p>
<p>Clearly, the calculation of tides is getting more complicated than we
might have thought. Before continuing on, we note that the solar tidal
forces are derived in a similar way. The relative importance of the sun
and moon are nearly the same. Although the sun is much more massive than
moon, it is much further away. $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}

<p>Before we can proceed further we need to know the position of moon and
sun relative to earth. An accurate description of the positions in three
dimensions is very difficult, and it involves learning arcane terms and
concepts from celestial mechanics. Here, I paraphrase a simplified
description from Pugh (1987). See also figure 4.1.</p>
<p>A natural reference system for an observer on earth is the equatorial
system described at the start of Chapter 3. In this system,
<em>declinations</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span> of a celestial body are measured north and south
of a plane which cuts the earth’s equator.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Angular distances around the plane are measured relative to a point on
this celestial equator which is fixed with respect to the stars. The
point chosen for this system is the <em>vernal equinox</em>, also called the
‘First Point of Aries’…The angle measured eastward, between Aries
and the equatorial intersection of the meridian through a celestial
object is called the <em>right ascension</em> of the object. The declination
and the right ascension together define the position of the object on
a celestial background…</p>
<p>[Another natural reference] system uses the plane of the earth’s
revolution around the sun as a reference. The celestial extension of
this plane, which is traced by the sun’s annual apparent movement, is
called the <em>ecliptic</em>. Conveniently, the point on this plane which is
chosen for a zero reference is also the vernal equinox, at which the
sun crosses the equatorial plane from south to north around 21 March
each year. Celestial objects are located by their ecliptic latitude
and ecliptic longitude. The angle between the two planes, of 23.45, is
called the obliquity of the ecliptic…—Pugh (1987: 72).</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">17.4.3. </span>Tidal Frequencies<a class="headerlink" href="#tidal-frequencies" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Now, let’s allow earth to spin about its polar axis. The changing
potential at a fixed geographic coordinate on earth is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\cos \varphi = \sin \varphi _p \sin \delta + \cos \varphi _p \cos \delta \cos (\tau
_{1} - 180^{\circ})\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>\varphi _p<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is latitude at which the tidal
potential is calculated, \)</span>\delta<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is declination of moon or sun north of
the equator, and \)</span>\tau _{1}$ is the hour angle of moon or sun. The <em>hour
angle</em> is the longitude where the imaginary plane containing the sun or
moon and earth’s rotation axis crosses the Equator.</p>
<p>The period of the solar hour angle is a solar day of 24 hr 0 m. The
period of the lunar hour angle is a lunar day of 24 hr 50.47 m.</p>
<p>Earth’s axis of rotation is inclined 23.45 with respect to the plane of
earth’s orbit about the sun. This defines the ecliptic, and the sun’s
declination varies between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta = \pm 23.45\)</span> with a period of one solar year. The orientation of earth’s
rotation axis precesses with respect to the stars with a period of 26
years. The rotation of the ecliptic plane causes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta\)</span> and the vernal
equinox to change slowly, and the movement called the <em>precession of the
equinoxes</em>.</p>
<p>Earth’s orbit about the sun is elliptical, with the sun in one focus.
That point in the orbit where the distance between the sun and earth is
a minimum is called <em>perigee</em>. The orientation of the ellipse in the
ecliptic plane changes slowly with time, causing perigee to rotate with
a period of 20 years. Therefore <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{sun}\)</span> varies with this period.</p>
<p>Moon’s orbit is also elliptical, but a description of moon’s orbit is
much more complicated than a description of earth’s orbit. Here are the
basics. The moon’s orbit lies in a plane inclined at a mean angle of
5.15 relative to the plane of the ecliptic. And lunar declination varies
between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta = 23.45 \pm 5.15\)</span> with a period of one tropical month of
27.32 solar days. The actual inclination of moon’s orbit varies between
4.97, and 5.32.</p>
<p>The shape of moon’s orbit also varies. First, perigee rotates with a
period of 8.85 years. The eccentricity of the orbit has a mean value of
0.0549, and it varies between 0.044 and 0.067. Second, the plane of
moon’s orbit rotates around earth’s axis of rotation with a period of
18.613 years. Both processes cause variations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_{moon}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that I am a little imprecise in defining the position of the sun
and moon. Lang (1980: § 5.1.2) gives much more precise definitions.</p>
<p>Substituting (17.15) into (17.9) gives: $$\begin{gathered}
V = \frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{R^{3}} \frac{1}{4} \left[ \left( 3 \sin ^{2} \varphi_p - 1

three terms with periods near 14 days, 24 hours, and 12 hours. Similarly

<p>Doodson (1922) expanded (17.16) in a Fourier series using the cleverly
chosen frequencies in table 17.1. Other choices of fundamental
frequencies are possible, for example the local, mean, solar time can be
used instead of the local, mean, lunar time. Doodson’s expansion,
however, leads to an elegant decomposition of tidal constituents into

<p>If the ocean surface is in equilibrium with the tidal potential, which
means we ignore inertia and currents and assume no land (Cartwright
1999: 274), the largest tidal constituents would have amplitudes given
in table 17.2. Notice that tides with frequencies near one or two cycles
per day are split into closely spaced lines with spacing separated by a
cycle per month. Each of these lines is further split into lines
separated by a cycle per year (figure 17.12). Furthermore, each of these
lines is split into lines separated by a cycle per 8.8 yr, and so on.
Clearly, there are very many possible tidal constituents.</p>
<p>Figure 17.12 <strong>Upper:</strong> Spectrum</p>
<p>of equilibrium tides with frequencies near twice per day. The spectrum
is split into groups separated by a cycle per month (0.55 deg/hr).
<strong>Lower:</strong> Expanded spectrum of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_2\)</span> group, showing splitting at a
cycle per year (0.04 deg/hr). The finest splitting in this figure is at
a cycle per 8.847 years (0.0046 deg/hr). From Richard Eanes, Center for
Space Research, University of Texas. <span id="combinedtides" label="combinedtides"></span></p>
<p>Why is the tide split into the many constituents shown in figure 17.12?
To answer the question, suppose moon’s elliptical orbit was in the
equatorial plane of earth. Then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta = 0\)</span>. From (17.16), the tidal
potential on the equator, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi_p =0\)</span>, is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V = \frac{\gamma M r^{2}}{R^{3}} \frac{1}{4} \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
If the ellipticity of the orbit is small, \)</span>R= R_0 (1+\epsilon )<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, and
(17.18) is approximately
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V = a (1-3\epsilon) \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>a=\left( \gamma M r^2 \right)/\left( 4 R^3 \right)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is a constant.
\)</span>\epsilon<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( varies with a period of 27.32 days, and we can write
\)</span>\epsilon = b \cos (2 \pi f_2)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>b$ is a small constant. With
these simplifications, (17.19) can be written:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
V &amp;= a \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right) -3 a b \cos \left( 2 \pi f_2 \right) \cos \left(4 \pi f_1 \right) \\
V &amp;= a \cos \left(4\pi f_1 \right) - 3 a b \left[ \cos 2\pi \left( 2f_1 - f_2 \right) + \cos 2\pi \left( 2f_1 + f_2 \right) \right]\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>which has a spectrum with three lines at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 f_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 f_1 \pm f_2\)</span>. Therefore, the slow modulation of the amplitude of the tidal
potential at two cycles per lunar day causes the potential to be split
into three frequencies. This is the way amplitude modulated AM radio
works. If we add in the slow changes in the shape of the orbit, we get
still more terms even in this very idealized case of a moon in an
equatorial orbit.</p>
<p>If you are very observant, you will have noticed that the tidal spectrum
in figure 17.12 does not look like the ocean-wave spectrum of ocean
waves in figure 16.6. Ocean waves have all possible frequencies, and
their spectrum is continuous. Tides have precise frequencies determined
by the orbit of earth and moon, and their spectrum is not continuous. It
consists of discrete lines.</p>
<p>Doodson’s expansion included 399 constituents, of which 100 are long
period, 160 are daily, 115 are twice per day, and 14 are thrice per day.
Most have very small amplitudes, and only the largest are included in
table 17.2. The largest tides were named by Sir George Darwin (1911) and
the names are included in the table. Thus, for example, the principal,
twice-per-day, lunar tide, which has Doodson number 255.555, is the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_2\)</span> tide, called the <em>M-two</em> tide.</p>

<p>If tides in the ocean were in equilibrium with the tidal potential,
tidal prediction would be much easier. Unfortunately, tides are far from
equilibrium. The shallow-water wave which is the tide cannot move fast
enough to keep up with sun and moon. On the equator, the tide would need
to propagate around the world in one day. This requires a wave speed of
around 460 m/s, which is only possible in an ocean 22 km deep. In
addition, the continents interrupt the propagation of the wave. How to
proceed?</p>
<p>We can separate the problem of tidal prediction into two parts. The
first deals with the prediction of tides in ports and shallow water
where tides can be measured by tide gauges. The second deals with the
prediction of tides in the deep ocean where tides are measured by
satellite altimeters.</p>
<section id="tidal-prediction-for-ports-and-shallow-water">
<h3><span class="section-number">17.5.1. </span>Tidal Prediction for Ports and Shallow Water<a class="headerlink" href="#tidal-prediction-for-ports-and-shallow-water" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Two methods are used to predict future tides at a tide-gauge station
using past observations of sea level measured at the gauge.</p>
<p><em>The Harmonic Method</em> This is the traditional method, and it is still
widely used. The method typically uses 19 years of data from a coastal
tide gauge from which the amplitude and phase of each tidal constituent
(the tidal harmonics) in the tide-gage record are calculated. The
frequencies used in the analysis are specified in advance from the basic
frequencies given in table 17.1.</p>
<p>Despite its simplicity, the technique had disadvantages compared with
the response method described below.</p>
<p>More than 18.6 years of data are needed to resolve the modulation of the
lunar tides.</p>
<p>Amplitude accuracy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-3}\)</span> of the largest term require that at
least 39 frequencies be determined. Doodson found 400 frequencies were
needed for an amplitude accuracy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-4}\)</span> of the largest term.</p>
<p>Non-tidal variability introduces large errors into the calculated
amplitudes and phases of the weaker tidal constituents. The weaker tides
have amplitudes smaller than variability at the same frequency due to
other processes such as wind set up and currents near the tide gauge.</p>
<p>At many ports, the tide is non-linear, and many more tidal constituents
are important. For some ports, the number of frequencies is
unmanageable. When tides propagate into very shallow water, especially
river estuaries, they steepen and become non-linear. This generates
harmonics of the original frequencies. In extreme cases, the incoming
waves steepens so much the leading edge is nearly vertical, and the wave
propagates as solitary wave. This is a <em>tidal bore</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Response Method</em> This method, developed by Munk and Cartwright
(1966), calculates the relationship between the observed tide at some
point and the tidal potential. The relationship is the spectral
admittance between the major tidal constituents and the tidal potential
at each station. The admittance is assumed to be a slowly varying
function of frequency so that the admittance of the major constituents
can be used for determining the response at nearby frequencies. Future
tides are calculated by multiplying the tidal potential by the
admittance function.</p>
<p>The technique requires only a few months of data.</p>
<p>The tidal potential is easily calculated, and a knowledge of the tidal
frequencies is not needed.</p>
<p>The admittance is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z(f) = G(f)/H(f)\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G(f)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H(f)\)</span> are the Fourier
transforms of the potential and the tide gage data, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is
frequency.</p>
<p>The admittance is inverse transformed to obtain the admittance as a
function of time.</p>
<p>The technique works only if the waves propagate as linear waves.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">17.5.2. </span>Tidal Prediction for Deep-Water<a class="headerlink" href="#tidal-prediction-for-deep-water" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Prediction of deep-ocean tides has been much more difficult than
prediction of shallow-water tides because tide gauges were seldom
deployed in deep water. All this changed with the launch of Topex/
Poseidon. The satellite was placed into an orbit especially designed for
observing ocean tides (Parke et al. 1987), and the altimetric system was
sufficiently accurate to measure many tidal constituents. Data from the
satellite have now been used to determine deep-ocean tides with an
accuracy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm \, 2\)</span> cm. For most practical purposes, the tides are
now known accurately for most of the ocean.</p>
<p>Two avenues led to the new knowledge of deep-water tides using
altimetry.</p>
<p><em>Prediction Using Hydrodynamic Theory</em> Purely theoretical calculations
of tides are not very accurate, especially because the dissipation of
tidal energy is not well known. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations
provided insight into processes influencing ocean tides. Several
processes must be considered:</p>
<p>The tides in one ocean basin perturb earth’s gravitational field, and
the mass in the tidal bulge attracts water in other ocean basins. The
self-gravitational attraction of the tides must be included.</p>
<p>The weight of the water in the tidal bulge is sufficiently great that it
deforms the sea floor. The earth deforms as an elastic solid, and the
deformation extends thousands of kilometers.</p>
<p>The ocean basins have a natural resonance close to the tidal
frequencies. The tidal bulge is a shallow-water wave on a rotating
ocean, and it propagates as a high tide rotating around the edge of the
basin. Thus the tides are a nearly resonant sloshing of water in the
ocean basin. The actual tide heights in deep water can be higher than
the equilibrium values noted in table 17.2.</p>
<p>Tides are dissipated by bottom friction especially in shallow seas, by
the flow over seamounts and mid-ocean ridges, and by the generation of
internal waves over seamounts and at the edges of continental shelves.
If the tidal forcing stopped, the tides would continue sloshing in the
ocean basins for several days.</p>
<p>Because the tide is a shallow-water wave everywhere, its velocity
depends on depth. Tides propagate more slowly over mid-ocean ridges and
shallow seas. Hence, the distance between grid points in numerical
models must be proportional to depth with very close spacing on
continental shelves (LeProvost et al. 1994).</p>
<p>Internal waves generated by the tides produce a small signal at the sea
surface near the tidal frequencies, but not phase-locked to the
potential. The noise near the frequency of the tides causes the spectral
cusps in the spectrum of sea-surface elevation first seen by Munk and
Cartwright (1966). The noise is due to deep-water, tidally generated,
internal waves.</p>
<p><em>Altimetry Plus Response Method</em> Several years of altimeter data from
Topex/ Poseidon have been used with the response method to calculate
deep-sea tides almost everywhere equatorward of 66 (Ma et al. 1994). The
altimeter measured sea-surface heights in geocentric coordinates at each
point along the sub-satellite track every 9.97 days. The temporal
sampling aliased the tides into long frequencies, but the aliased
periods are precisely known and the tides can be recovered (Parke et
al. 1987). Because the tidal record is shorter than 8 years, the
altimeter data are used with the response method to obtain predictions
for a much longer time.</p>
<p>Recent solutions by ten different groups, have accuracy of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm \,\)</span><!-- -->2.8 cm in deep water (Andersen, Woodworth, and
Flather, 1995). Work has begun to improve knowledge of tides in shallow
water.</p>
<p>Figure 17.13 Global map of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_2\)</span> tide</p>
<p>calculated from Topex/Poseidon observations of the height of the sea
surface combined with the response method for extracting tidal
information. Full lines are contours of constant tidal phase, contour
interval is 30. Dashed lines are lines of constant amplitude, contour
interval is 10 cm. From Richard Ray, <span class="smallcaps">nasa</span> Goddard Space
Flight Center. <span id="fig:m2_tide" label="fig:m2_tide"></span></p>
<p><em>Altimetry Plus Numerical Models</em> Altimeter data can be used directly
with numerical models of the tides to calculate tides in all areas of
the ocean from deep water all the way to the coast. Thus the technique
is especially useful for determining tides near coasts and over
sea-floor features where the altimeter ground track is too widely spaced
to sample the tides well in space. Tide models use finite-element grids
similar to the one shown in figure 15.3. Recent numerical calculations
by (LeProvost et al. 1994; LeProvost, Bennett, and Cartwright, 1995)
give global tides with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span> 2–3 cm accuracy and full spatial
resolution.</p>
<p>Maps produced by this method show the essential features of the
deep-ocean tides (figure 17.13). The tide consists of a crest that
rotates counterclockwise around the ocean basins in the northern
hemisphere, and in the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere.
Points of minimum amplitude are called <em>amphidromes</em>. Highest tides tend
to be along the coast.</p>
<p>The maps also show the importance of the size of the ocean basins. The
semi-diurnal (12 hr period) tides are relatively large in all ocean
basins. But the diurnal (24 hr period) tides are small in the Atlantic
and relatively large in the Pacific and Indian ocean. The Atlantic is
too small to have a resonant sloshing with a period near 24 hr.</p>

<section id="tidal-dissipation">
<h3><span class="section-number">17.5.3. </span>Tidal Dissipation<a class="headerlink" href="#tidal-dissipation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Tides dissipate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.75\pm0.08\)</span> TW of power (Kantha, 1998), of which 3.5
TW are dissipated in the ocean, and much smaller amounts in the
atmosphere and solid earth. The dissipation increases the length of day
by about 2.07 milliseconds per century, it causes the semimajor axis of
moon’s orbit to increase by 3.86 cm/yr, and it mixes water masses in the
ocean.</p>
<p>The calculations of dissipation from Topex/Poseidon observations of
tides are remarkably close to estimates from lunar-laser ranging,
astronomical observations, and ancient eclipse records. The calculations
show that roughly two thirds of the M2 tidal energy is dissipated on
shelves and in shallow seas, and one third is transferred to internal
waves and dissipated in the deep ocean (Egbert and ray, 2000). 85 to 90%
of the energy of the K1 tide is dissipated in shallow water, and only
about 10–15% is transferred to internal waves in the deep ocean
(LeProvost 2003, personal communication).</p>
<p>Overall, our knowledge of the tides is now sufficiently good that we can
begin to use the information to study mixing in the ocean. Recent
results show that “tides are perhaps responsible for a large portion of
the vertical mixing in the ocean” (Jayne et al. 2004). Remember, mixing
helps drive the abyssal circulation in the ocean as discussed in §13.2
(Munk and Wunsch, 1998). Who would have thought that an understanding of
the influence of the ocean on climate would require accurate knowledge
of tides?</p>

<p>Shallow water tides are predicted using tide measurements made in
ports and other locations along the coast. Tidal records of just a
few months duration can be used to predict tides many years into the
future.</p>
<p>Tides in deep water are calculated from altimetric measurements,
especially Topex/Poseidon measurements. As a result, deep water
tides are known almost everywhere with an accuracy approaching
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 2\)</span> cm.</p>
<p>The dissipation of tidal energy in the ocean transfers angular
momentum from moon to earth, causing the day to become longer.</p>
<p>Tidal dissipation mixes water masses, and it is a major driver of
the deep, meridional-overturning circulation. Tides, abyssal
circulation, and climate are closely linked.</p>
