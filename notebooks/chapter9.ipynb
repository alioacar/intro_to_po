    "# Response of the Upper Ocean to Winds\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have had a chance to travel around the United States, you may\n",
    "have noticed that the climate of the east coast differs considerably\n",
    "from that on the west coast. Why? Why is the climate of Charleston,\n",
    "South Carolina so different from that of San Diego, although both are\n",
    "near 32N, and both are on or near the ocean? Charleston has 125–150 cm\n",
    "of rain a year, San Diego has 25–50 cm, Charleston has hot summers, San\n",
    "Diego has cool summers. Or why is the climate of San Francisco so\n",
    "different from that of Norfolk, Virginia?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look closely at the characteristics of the atmosphere along the\n",
    "two coasts near 32N, we find more differences that may explain the\n",
    "climate. For example, when the wind blows onshore toward San Diego, it\n",
    "brings a cool, moist, marine, boundary layer a few hundred meters thick\n",
    "capped by much warmer, dry air. On the east coast, when the wind blows\n",
    "onshore, it brings a warm, moist, marine, boundary layer that is much\n",
    "thicker. Convection, which produces rain, is much easier on the east\n",
    "coast than on the west coast. Why then is the atmospheric boundary layer\n",
    "over the water so different on the two coasts? The answer can be found\n",
    "in part by studying the ocean’s response to local winds, the subject of\n",
    "this chapter.\n",

    "## Inertial Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our study of currents near the sea surface, let’s consider\n",
    "first a very simple solution to the equations of motion, the response of\n",
    "the ocean to an impulse that sets the water in motion. For example, the\n",
    "impulse can be a strong wind blowing for a few hours. The water then\n",
    "moves only under the influence of Coriolis force. No other force acts on\n",
    "the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such motion is said to be inertial. The mass of water continues to move\n",
    "due to its inertia. If the water were in space, it would move in a\n",
    "straight line according to Newton’s second law. But on a rotating earth,\n",
    "the motion is much different.\n",
    "\n",
    "From (7.12) the equations of motion for a parcel of water moving in the\n",
    "ocean without friction are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "$= 7.292 \\times 10^{-5}$ rad/s is the rotation of the earth in fixed\n",
    "coordinates, and $\\varphi$ is latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now look for simple solutions to these equations. To do this we\n",
    "must simplify the momentum equations. First, if only the Coriolis force\n",
    "acts on the water, there must be no horizontal pressure gradient:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{y}} = 0$$\n",
    "Furthermore, we can assume that the flow is horizontal, and (9.1)\n",

    "##### Nansen’s Qualitative Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Fridtjof Nansen noticed that wind tended to blow ice at an angle of\n",
    "20–40 to the right of the wind in the Arctic, by which he meant that\n",
    "the track of the iceberg was to the right of the wind looking downwind\n",
    "(See figure 9.2). He later worked out the balance of forces that must\n",
    "exist when wind tried to push icebergs downwind on a rotating earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nansen argued that three forces must be important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind Stress, **W**; Friction **F** (otherwise the iceberg would move as\n",
    "fast as the wind); Coriolis Force, **C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nansen argued further that the forces must have the following\n",
    "attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Drag must be opposite the direction of the ice’s velocity; Coriolis\n",
    "force must be perpendicular to the velocity; The forces must balance for\n",
    "steady flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**W** + **F** + **C** = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ekman’s Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Nansen asked Vilhelm Bjerknes to let one of Bjerknes’ students make a\n",
    "theoretical study of the influence of earth’s rotation on wind-driven\n",
    "currents. Walfrid Ekman was chosen, and he presented the results in his\n",
    "thesis at Uppsala (Kullenberg, 1954). Ekman later expanded the study to\n",
    "include the influence of continents and differences of density of water\n",
    "(Ekman, 1905). The following follows Ekman’s line of reasoning in that\n",
    "paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 9.2 The balance of forces\n",
    "\n",
    "acting on an iceberg in a wind on a rotating earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:forcesketch\" label=\"fig:forcesketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ekman assumed a steady, homogeneous, horizontal flow with friction on a\n",
    "rotating earth. Thus horizontal and temporal derivatives are zero:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{t}}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{x}}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{y}}=0$$\n",
    "For flow on a rotating earth, this leaves a balance between frictional\n",
    "and Coriolis forces (8.15). Ekman further assumed a constant vertical\n",
    "eddy viscosity of the form (8:13):\n",
    "$$T_{xz} \\,=\\,\\rho\\, A_z \\,\\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{z}}\\: , \\qquad T_{yz}\\,=\\,\\rho\\, A_z \\,\\frac{\\partial{v}}{\\partial{z}}$$\n",
    "where $T_{xz}$, $T_{yz}$ are the components of the wind stress in the\n",
    "$x$, $y$ directions, and $\\rho$ is the density of sea water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using (9.7) in (8.15), the $x$ and $y$ momentum equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "fv +  A_z \\, \\frac{\\partial{^2 u}}{\\partial{z^2}} &= 0  \\\\\n",

    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "a=\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{2A_z}}$$ and $V_0$ is the velocity of the current at\n",
    "the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Values for Ekman’s Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed further, we need values for any two of the free parameters:\n",
    "the velocity at the surface, $V_0$; the coefficient of eddy viscosity,\n",
    "$A_z$; or the wind stress $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind stress is well known, and Ekman used the bulk formula (4.2):\n",
    "$$T_{yz} = T = \\rho_{air}\\, C_D \\,U_{10}^2$$ where $\\rho_{air}$ is the\n",
    "density of air, $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, and $U_{10}$ is the wind\n",
    "speed at 10 m above the sea. Ekman turned to the literature to obtain\n",
    "values for $V_0$ as a function of wind speed. He found:\n",
    "$$V_0 = \\frac{0.0127}{\\sqrt{\\sin|\\varphi|}}\\, U_{10}, \\qquad \\qquad\n",
    "|\\varphi|\\ge 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, he could then calculate the velocity as a\n",
    "function of depth knowing the wind speed $U_{10}$ and wind direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ekman Layer Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The thickness of the Ekman layer is arbitrary because the Ekman currents\n",
    "decrease exponentially with depth. Ekman proposed that the thickness be\n",
    "the depth $D_E$ at which the current velocity is opposite the velocity\n",
    "at the surface, which occurs at a depth $D_E = \\pi/a$, and the *Ekman\n",
    "layer depth* is: $$\\boxed{D_E = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi^2\\,A_z}{f}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using (9.13) in (9.10), dividing by $U_{10}$, and using (9.14) and\n",
    "(9.15) gives: $$D_E = \\frac{7.6}{\\sqrt{\\sin|\\varphi|}}\\, U_{10}$$ in SI\n",
    "units. Wind in meters per second gives depth in meters. The constant in\n",
    "(9.16) is based on $\\rho = 1027$ kg/m$^3$, $\\rho_{air} = 1.25$ kg/m$^3$,\n",
    "and Ekman’s value of $C_D = 2.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ for the drag\n",
    "coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using (9.16) with typical winds, the depth of the Ekman layer varies\n",
    "from about 45 to 300 meters (Table 9.3), and the velocity of the surface\n",
    "current varies from 2.5% to 1.1% of the wind speed depending on\n",

    "##### The Ekman Number: Coriolis and Frictional Forces\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the Ekman layer is closely related to the depth at which\n",
    "frictional force is equal to the Coriolis force in the momentum equation\n",
    "(9.9). The Coriolis force is $f u$, and the frictional force is\n",
    "$A_z \\partial^2 U/\\partial z^2$. The ratio of the forces, which is non\n",
    "dimensional, is called the *Ekman Number* $E_z$:\n",
    "$$E_z=\\frac{\\text{Friction Force}}{\\text{Coriolis Force}} = \\frac{\\D A_z\\frac{\\D\\partial^2u}{\\partial{z^2}}}{fu} = \\frac{\\D A_z\\frac{\\D\n",
    "u}{\\D d^2}}{\\D fu}$$ $$\\boxed{E_z = \\frac{A_z}{f\\,d^2}}$$ where we have\n",
    "approximated the terms using typical velocities $u$, and typical depths\n",
    "$d$. The subscript $z$ is needed because the ocean is stratified and\n",
    "mixing in the vertical is much less than mixing in the horizontal. Note\n",
    "that as depth increases, friction becomes small, and eventually, only\n",
    "the Coriolis force remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving (9.17) for $d$ gives $$d = \\sqrt{\\frac{A_z}{fE_z}}$$ which\n",
    "agrees with the functional form (9.15) proposed by Ekman. Equating\n",
    "(9.18) and (9.15) requires $E_z = 1/(2\\pi^2) = 0.05$ at the Ekman depth.\n",
    "Thus Ekman chose a depth at which frictional forces are much smaller\n",
    "than the Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bottom Ekman Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ekman layer at the bottom of the ocean and the atmosphere differs\n",
    "from the layer at the ocean surface. The solution for a bottom layer\n",
    "below a fluid with velocity $U$ in the $x$-direction is:\n",

    "##### Examining Ekman’s Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before considering the validity of Ekman’s theory for describing flow in\n",
    "the surface boundary layer of the ocean, let’s first examine the\n",
    "validity of Ekman’s assumptions. He assumed:\n",
    "\n",
    "No boundaries. This is valid away from coasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep water. This is valid if depth $\\gg 200$ m.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f$-plane. This is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steady state. This is valid if wind blows for longer than a pendulum\n",
    "day. Note however that Ekman also calculated a time-dependent solution,\n",
    "as did Hasselmann (1970).\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_z$ is a function of $U^2_{10}$ only. It is assumed to be independent\n",
    "of depth. This is not a good assumption. The mixed layer may be thinner\n",
    "than the Ekman depth, and $A_z$ will change rapidly at the bottom of the\n",
    "mixed layer because mixing is a function of stability. Mixing across a\n",
    "stable layer is much less than mixing through a layer of a neutral\n",
    "stability. More realistic profiles for the coefficient of eddy viscosity\n",
    "as a function of depth change the shape of the calculated velocity\n",
    "profile. I reconsider this problem below.\n",

    "Homogeneous density. This is probably good, except as it effects\n",

    "## Ekman Mass Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow in the Ekman layer at the sea surface carries mass. For many\n",
    "reasons we may want to know the total mass transported in the layer. The\n",
    "*Ekman mass transport* $M_E$ is defined as the integral of the Ekman\n",
    "velocity $U_E, V_E$ from the surface to a depth $d$ below the Ekman\n",
    "layer. The two components of the transport are $M_{Ex}$, $M_{Ey}$ :\n",
    "$$M_{Ex} = \\int^0_{-d} \\rho U_E \\, dz, \\qquad\n",
    "M_{Ey} = \\int^0_{-d} \\rho V_E \\, dz$$ The transport has units\n",
    "kg/(m$\\cdot$s). It is the mass of water passing through a vertical plane\n",
    "one meter wide that is perpendicular to the transport and extending from\n",
    "the surface to depth $-d$ (figure 9.7).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "defining **Left:** mass transports, and **Right:** volume transports.\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:transportsketch\" label=\"fig:transportsketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the Ekman mass transports by integrating (8.15) in (9.24):\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "hundred meters below the surface the Ekman velocities approach zero, and\n",
    "the last term of (9.25) is zero. Thus mass transport is due only to wind\n",
    "stress at the sea surface $(z = 0)$. In a similar way, we can calculate\n",
    "the transport in the $x$ direction to obtain the two components of the\n",
    "*Ekman transport*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "f\\,M_{Ey} &= -T_{xz}(0) \\\\\n",
    "f\\,M_{Ex} &= \\;\\;\\; T_{yz}(0)\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{xz}(0), T_{yz}(0)$ are the two components of the stress at the\n",
    "sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the transport is perpendicular to the wind stress, and to\n",
    "the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere. If the wind is to the\n",
    "north in the positive $y$ direction (a south wind), then $T_{xz}(0) = 0$, $M_{Ey} = 0$, and $M_{Ex} = T_{yz}(0)/f$. In the northern\n",
    "hemisphere, $f$ is positive, and the mass transport is in the $x$\n",
    "direction, to the east.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem strange that the drag of the wind on the water leads to a\n",
    "current at right angles to the drag. The result follows from the\n",
    "assumption that friction is confined to a thin surface boundary layer,\n",
    "that it is zero in the interior of the ocean, and that the current is in\n",
    "equilibrium with the wind so that it is no longer accelerating.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Volume transport* $Q$ is the mass transport divided by the density of\n",
    "water and multiplied by the width perpendicular to the transport.\n",
    "$$Q_x=\\frac{Y M_x}{\\rho}, \\qquad Q_y=\\frac{X M_y}{\\rho}$$ where $Y$ is\n",
    "the north-south distance across which the eastward transport $Q_x$ is\n",
    "calculated, and $X$ in the east-west distance across which the northward\n",
    "transport $Q_y$ is calculated. Volume transport has dimensions of cubic\n",
    "meters per second. A convenient unit for volume transport in the ocean\n",
    "is a million cubic meters per second. This unit is called a *Sverdrup*,\n",
    "and it is abbreviated Sv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent observations of Ekman transport in the ocean agree with the\n",
    "theoretical values (9.26). Chereskin and Roemmich (1991) measured the\n",
    "Ekman volume transport across 11N in the Atlantic using an acoustic\n",

    "averaged over many years at 11N.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use of Transports\n",
    "\n",
    "Mass transports are widely used for two important reasons. First, the\n",
    "calculation is much more robust than calculations of velocities in the\n",
    "Ekman layer. By robust, I mean that the calculation is based on fewer\n",
    "assumptions, and that the results are more likely to be correct. Thus\n",
    "the calculated mass transport does not depend on knowing the\n",
    "distribution of velocity in the Ekman layer or the eddy viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the variability of transport in space has important\n",
    "consequences. Let’s look at a few applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application of Ekman Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Because steady winds blowing on the sea surface produce an Ekman layer\n",
    "that transports water at right angles to the wind direction, any spatial\n",
    "variability of the wind, or winds blowing along some coasts, can lead to\n",
    "upwelling. And upwelling is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Upwelling enhances biological productivity, which feeds fisheries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold upwelled water alters local weather. Weather onshore of regions of\n",
    "upwelling tend to have fog, low stratus clouds, a stable stratified\n",
    "atmosphere, little convection, and little rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial variability of transports in the open ocean leads to upwelling\n",
    "and downwelling, which leads to redistribution of mass in the ocean,\n",
    "which leads to wind-driven geostrophic currents via Ekman pumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coastal Upwelling\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how winds lead to upwelling, consider north winds blowing\n",
    "parallel to the California Coast (figure 9.8 left). The winds produce a\n",
    "mass transport away from the shore everywhere along the shore. The water\n",
    "pushed offshore can be replaced only by water from below the Ekman\n",
    "layer. This is *upwelling* (figure 9.8 right). Because the upwelled\n",
    "water is cold, the upwelling leads to a region of cold water at the\n",
    "surface along the coast. Figure 10.16 shows the distribution of cold\n",
    "water off the coast of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 9.8 Sketch of\n",
    "\n",
    "Ekman transport along a coast leading to upwelling of cold water along\n",
    "the coast. **Left:** Plan view. North winds along a west coast in the\n",
    "northern hemisphere cause Ekman transports away from the shore.\n",
    "**Right:** Cross section. The water transported offshore must be\n",
    "replaced by water upwelling from below the mixed layer.\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:upwelling\" label=\"fig:upwelling\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Upwelled water is colder than water normally found on the surface, and\n",
    "it is richer in nutrients. The nutrients fertilize phytoplankton in the\n",
    "mixed layer, which are eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by small\n",
    "fish, which are eaten by larger fish and so on to infinity. As a result,\n",
    "upwelling regions are productive waters supporting the world’s major\n",
    "fisheries. The important regions are offshore of Peru, California,\n",
    "Somalia, Morocco, and Namibia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can answer the question I asked at the beginning of the chapter:\n",
    "Why is the climate of San Francisco so different from that of Norfolk,\n",
    "Virginia? Figures 4.2 or 9.8 show that wind along the California and\n",
    "Oregon coasts has a strong southward component. The wind causes\n",
    "upwelling along the coast, which leads to cold water close to shore. The\n",
    "shoreward component of the wind brings warmer air from far offshore over\n",
    "the colder water, which cools the incoming air close to the sea, leading\n",
    "to a thin, cool atmospheric boundary layer. As the air cools, fog forms\n",
    "along the coast. Finally, the cool layer of air is blown over San\n",
    "Francisco, cooling the city. The warmer air above the boundary layer,\n",
    "due to downward velocity of the Hadley circulation in the atmosphere\n",
    "(see figure 4.3), inhibits vertical convection, and rain is rare. Rain\n",
    "forms only when winter storms coming ashore bring strong convection\n",
    "higher up in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to upwelling, other processes influence weather in\n",
    "California and Virginia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oceanic mixed layer tends to be thin on the eastern side of ocean,\n",
    "and upwelling can easily bring up cold water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currents along the eastern side of the ocean at mid-latitudes tend to\n",
    "bring colder water from higher latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these processes are reversed offshore of east coasts, leading to\n",
    "warm water close to shore, thick atmospheric boundary layers, and\n",
    "frequent convective rain. Thus Norfolk is much different that San\n",
    "Francisco due to upwelling and the direction of the coastal currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ekman Pumping\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal variability of the wind blowing on the sea surface leads\n",
    "to horizontal variability of the Ekman transports. Because mass must be\n",
    "conserved, the spatial variability of the transports must lead to\n",
    "vertical velocities at the top of the Ekman layer. To calculate this\n",

    "divergence operator. (9.28) states that the horizontal divergence of the\n",
    "Ekman transports leads to a vertical velocity in the upper boundary\n",
    "layer of the ocean, a process called *Ekman Pumping*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the Ekman mass transports (9.26) in (9.28) we can relate Ekman\n",
    "pumping to the wind stress.\n",

    "Langmuir circulation (Langmuir, 1938), a current that spiral around an\n",

    "a flow during an experiment to measure the wind-driven circulation in\n",
    "the upper 50 meters of the sea. They found that during a period when the\n",
    "wind speed was 14 m/s, surface currents were organized into Langmuir\n",
    "cells spaced 20 m apart, the cells were aligned at an angle of 15 to the\n",
    "right of the wind, and vertical velocity at 23 m depth was concentrated\n",
    "in narrow jets under the areas of surface convergence (figure 9.9).\n",
    "Maximum vertical velocity was $-0.18$ m/s. The seasonal thermocline was\n",
    "at 50 m, and no downward velocity was observed in or below the\n",
    "thermocline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Changes in wind stress produce transient oscillations in the ocean\n",
    "    called inertial currents\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inertial currents are very common in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The period of the current is $(2 \\pi)/f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Steady winds produce a thin boundary layer, the Ekman layer, at the\n",
    "    top of the ocean. Ekman boundary layers also exist at the bottom of\n",
    "    the ocean and the atmosphere. The Ekman layer in the atmosphere\n",
    "    above the sea surface is called the planetary boundary layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Ekman layer at the sea surface has the following\n",
    "    characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Direction*: 45to the right of the wind looking downwind in the\n",
    "    Northern Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Surface Speed*: 1–2.5% of wind speed depending on latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Depth*: approximately 40–300 m depending on latitude and wind\n",
    "    velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Careful measurements of currents near the sea surface show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inertial oscillations are the largest component of the current in\n",
    "    the mixed layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The flow is nearly independent of depth within the mixed layer for\n",
    "    periods near the inertial period. Thus the mixed layer moves like a\n",
    "    slab at the inertial period.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An Ekman layer exists in the atmosphere just above the sea (and\n",
    "    land) surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Surface drifters tend to drift parallel to lines of constant\n",
    "    atmospheric pressure at the sea surface. This is consistent with\n",
    "    Ekman’s theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The flow averaged over many inertial periods is almost exactly that\n",
    "    calculated from Ekman’s theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transport is 90 to the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spatial variability of Ekman transport, due to spatial variability\n",
    "    of winds over distances of hundreds of kilometers and days, leads to\n",
    "    convergence and divergence of the transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Winds blowing toward the equator along west coasts of continents\n",
    "    produces upwelling along the coast. This leads to cold, productive\n",
    "    waters within about 100 km of the shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upwelled water along west coasts of continents modifies the weather\n",
