    "# Vorticity in the Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the fluid flows with which we are familiar, from bathtubs to\n",
    "swimming pools, are not rotating, or they are rotating so slowly that\n",
    "rotation is not important except maybe at the drain of a bathtub as\n",
    "water is let out. As a result, we do not have a good intuitive\n",
    "understanding of rotating flows. In the ocean, rotation and the\n",
    "conservation of vorticity strongly influence flow over distances\n",
    "exceeding a few tens of kilometers. The consequences of the rotation\n",
    "leads to results we have not seen before in our day-to-day dealings with\n",
    "fluids. For example, did you ask yourself why the curl of the wind\n",
    "stress leads to a mass transport in the north-south direction and not in\n",
    "the east-west direction? What is special about north-south motion? In\n",
    "this chapter, I will explore some of the consequences of rotation for\n",
    "flow in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions of Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, vorticity is the rotation of the fluid. The rate of\n",
    "rotation can be defined various ways. Consider a bowl of water sitting\n",
    "on a table in a laboratory. The water may be spinning in the bowl. In\n",
    "addition to the spinning of the water, the bowl and the laboratory are\n",
    "rotating because they are on a rotating earth. The two processes are\n",
    "separate and lead to two types of vorticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Planetary Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything on earth, including the ocean, the atmosphere, and bowls of\n",
    "water, rotates with the earth. This rotation is the *planetary\n",
    "vorticity* $f$. It is twice the local rate of rotation of earth:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{f \\equiv 2\\,\\Omega \\sin \\varphi \\,\\, \\text{(radians/s)} = 2 \\sin \\varphi\n",
    "\\,\\, \\text{(cycles/day)}}$$ Planetary vorticity is the Coriolis\n",
    "parameter I used earlier to discuss flow in the ocean. It is greatest at\n",
    "the poles where it is twice the rotation rate of earth. Note that the\n",
    "vorticity vanishes at the equator and that the vorticity in the southern\n",
    "hemisphere is negative because $\\varphi$ is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relative Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean and atmosphere do not rotate at exactly the same rate as\n",
    "earth. They have some rotation relative to earth due to currents and\n",
    "winds. *Relative vorticity* $\\zeta$ is the vorticity due to currents in\n",
    "the ocean. Mathematically it is:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{ \\zeta \\equiv \\text{curl}_z\\, \\textbf{V} =\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{v}}{\\partial{x}}-\\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{y}} }$$\n",
    "where $\\textbf{V} = (u, v)$ is the horizontal velocity vector, and where\n",
    "we have assumed that the flow is two-dimensional. This is true if the\n",
    "flow extends over distances greater than a few tens of kilometers.\n",
    "$\\zeta$ is the vertical component of the three-dimensional vorticity\n",
    "vector $\\omega$, and it is sometimes written $\\omega{_z}$. $\\zeta$ is\n",
    "positive for counter-clockwise rotation viewed from above. This is the\n",
    "same sense as earth’s rotation in the northern hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on Symbols* Symbols commonly used in one part of oceanography\n",
    "often have very different meaning in another part. Here I use $\\zeta$\n",
    "for vorticity, but in Chapter 10, I used $\\zeta$ to mean the height of\n",
    "the sea surface. I could use $\\omega_z$ for relative vorticity, but\n",
    "$\\omega$ is also commonly used to mean frequency in radians per second.\n",
    "I have tried to eliminate most confusing uses, but the dual use of\n",
    "$\\zeta$ is one we will have to live with. Fortunately, it shouldn’t\n",
    "cause much confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a rigid body rotating at rate $\\Omega$, curl**V** $=2\\,\\Omega$. Of\n",
    "course, the flow does not need to rotate as a rigid body to have\n",
    "relative vorticity. Vorticity can also result from shear. For example,\n",
    "at a north/south western boundary in the ocean, $u=0$, $v=v(x)$ and\n",
    "$\\zeta = \\partial{v(x)}/\\partial{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\zeta$ is usually much smaller than $f$, and it is greatest at the edge\n",
    "of fast currents such as the Gulf Stream. To obtain some understanding\n",
    "of the size of $\\zeta$, consider the edge of the Gulf Stream off Cape\n",
    "Hatteras where the velocity decreases by 1 m/s in 100 km at the\n",
    "boundary. The curl of the current is approximately (1 m/s)/(100 km) =\n",
    "0.14 cycles/day = 1 cycle/week. Hence even this large relative vorticity\n",
    "is still almost seven times smaller than $f$. A more typical values of\n",
    "relative vorticity, such as the vorticity of eddies, is a cycle per\n",
    "month.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Absolute Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the planetary and relative vorticity is called *absolute\n",
    "vorticity*: $$\\boxed{ \\text{Absolute Vorticity} \\equiv (\\zeta + f) }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can obtain an equation for absolute vorticity in the ocean by\n",
    "manipulating the equations of motion for frictionless flow. We begin\n",
    "with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{Du}{Dt} -f\\,v &= -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\,\\frac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{x}} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{Dv}{Dt} +f\\,u &= -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\,\\frac{\\partial{p}}{\\partial{y}}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we expand the substantial derivative, and if we subtract\n",
    "$\\partial\\:/\\partial{y}$ of (12.4a) from $\\partial\\:/\\partial{x}$ of\n",
    "(12.4b) to eliminate the pressure terms, we obtain after some algebraic\n",
    "manipulations:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{ \\frac{D}{Dt}\\left(\\zeta +f  \\right) + \\left(\\zeta +f  \\right)\n",
    "\\left(\\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{x}} +\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{v}}{\\partial{y}} \\right) = 0 }$$ In deriving (12.5) we\n",
    "used: $$\\frac{Df}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{t}}\n",
    "+u\\,\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} +v\\,\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} = \\beta\n",
    "\\,v \\notag$$ because $f$ is independent of time $t$ and eastward\n",
    "distance $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation rate of a column of fluid changes as the column is expanded\n",
    "or contracted. This changes the vorticity through changes in $\\zeta$. To\n",
    "see how this happens, consider barotropic, geostrophic flow in an ocean\n",
    "with depth $H(x, y, t)$, where $H$ is the distance from the sea surface\n",
    "to the bottom. That is, we allow the surface to have topography (figure\n",
    "12.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12.1 Sketch of fluid flow used\n",
    "\n",
    "for deriving conservation of  \n",
    "potential vorticity. After Cushman-Roisin (1994: 55).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:vorticitysketch\" label=\"fig:vorticitysketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating the continuity equation (7.19) from the bottom to the top of\n",
    "the ocean gives (Cushman-Roisin, 1994):\n",
    "$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{x}} + \\frac{\\partial{v}}{\\partial{y}}\\right) \\int_{b}^{b+H} dz + w \\bigr|_{b}^{b+H} = 0$$\n",
    "where $b$ is the topography of the bottom, and $H$ is the depth of the\n",
    "water. Notice that $\\partial{u}/\\partial{x}$ and\n",
    "$\\partial{v}/\\partial{y}$ are independent of $z$ because they are\n",
    "barotropic, and the terms can be taken outside the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions require that flow at the surface and the bottom\n",
    "be along the surface and the bottom. Thus the vertical velocities at the\n",
    "top and the bottom are: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "w(b+H) &= \\frac{\\partial{(b+H)}}{\\partial{t}} + u\\,\\frac{\\partial{(b+H)}}{\\partial{x}}+v\\, \\frac{\\partial{(b+H)}}{\\partial{y}} \\\\\n",
    "w(b) &= u\\,\\frac{\\partial{(b)}}{\\partial{x}}+v\\,\\frac{\\partial{(b)}}{\\partial{y}}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "where we used $\\partial{b}/\\partial{t} = 0$ because the bottom does not\n",
    "move, and $\\partial{H}/\\partial{z} = 0$. Substituting (12.7) and (12.8)\n",
    "into (12.6) we obtain\n",
    "$$\\left( \\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{x}} + \\frac{\\partial{v}}{\\partial{y}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{H}\\,\\frac{DH}{Dt} = 0$$\n",
    "Substituting this into (12.5) gives:\n",
    "$$\\frac{D}{Dt}\\left(\\zeta +f  \\right) -\\frac{\\left(\\zeta +f\n",
    "\\right)}{H}\\,\\frac{DH}{Dt} = 0$$ which can be written:\n",
    "$$\\frac{D }{Dt}\\,\\left( \\frac{\\zeta + f}{H} \\right) = 0$$ The quantity\n",
    "within the parentheses must be constant. It is called *potential\n",
    "vorticity* $\\Pi$. Potential vorticity is conserved along a fluid\n",
    "trajectory:\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\text{Potential Vorticity} = \\Pi \\equiv \\frac{\\zeta + f}{H} }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For baroclinic flow in a continuously stratified fluid, the potential\n",
    "vorticity can be written (Pedlosky, 1987: §2.5):\n",
    "$$\\Pi = \\frac{\\zeta + f}{\\rho} \\cdot \\nabla \\lambda$$ where $\\lambda$ is\n",
    "any conserved quantity for each fluid element. In, particular, if\n",
    "$\\lambda = \\rho$ then:\n",
    "$$\\Pi = \\frac{\\zeta + f}{\\rho}\\,\\frac{\\partial{\\rho}}{\\partial{z}}$$\n",
    "assuming the horizontal gradients of density are small compared with the\n",
    "vertical gradients, a good assumption in the thermocline. In most of the\n",
    "interior of the ocean, $f \\gg \\zeta$ and (12.11) is written (Pedlosky,\n",
    "1996, eq 3.11.2):\n",
    "$$\\Pi = \\frac{f}{\\rho}\\,\\frac{\\partial{\\rho}}{\\partial{z}}$$ This allows\n",
    "the potential vorticity of various layers of the ocean to be determined\n",
    "directly from hydrographic data without knowledge of the velocity field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conservation of Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular momentum of any isolated spinning body is conserved. The\n",
    "spinning body can be an eddy in the ocean or the earth in space. If the\n",
    "the spinning body is not isolated, that is, if it is linked to another\n",
    "body, then angular momentum can be transferred between the bodies. The\n",
    "two bodies need not be in physical contact. Gravitational forces can\n",
    "transfer momentum between bodies in space. I will return to this topic\n",
    "in Chapter 17 when I discuss tides in the ocean. Here, let’s look at\n",
    "conservation of vorticity in a spinning ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friction is essential for the transfer of momentum in a fluid. Friction\n",
    "transfers momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean through the thin,\n",
    "frictional, Ekman layer at the sea surface. Friction transfers momentum\n",
    "from the ocean to the solid earth through the Ekman layer at the sea\n",
    "floor. Friction along the sides of sub-sea mountains leads to pressure\n",
    "differences on either side of the mountain which causes another kind of\n",
    "drag called *form drag*. This is the same drag that causes wind force on\n",
    "cars moving at high speed. In the vast interior of the ocean, however,\n",
    "the flow is frictionless, and vorticity is conserved. Such a flow is\n",
    "said to be *conservative*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conservation of Potential Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The conservation of potential vorticity couples changes in depth,\n",
    "relative vorticity, and changes in latitude. All three interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in the depth $H$ of the flow changes in the relative vorticity.\n",
    "The concept is analogous with the way figure skaters decreases their\n",
    "spin by extending their arms and legs. The action increases their moment\n",
    "of inertia and decreases their rate of spin (figure 12.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12.2 Sketch of the\n",
    "\n",
    "production of relative vorticity by the changes in the height of a fluid\n",
    "column. As the vertical fluid column moves from left to right, vertical\n",
    "stretching reduces the moment of inertia of the column, causing it to\n",
    "spin faster. <span id=\"fig:spinsketch\" label=\"fig:spinsketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in latitude require a corresponding change in $\\zeta$. As a\n",
    "column of water moves equatorward, $f$ decreases, and $\\zeta$ must\n",
    "increase (figure 12.3). If this seems somewhat mysterious, von Arx\n",
    "(1962) suggests we consider a barrel of water at rest at the north pole.\n",
    "If the barrel is moved southward, the water in it retains the rotation\n",
    "it had at the pole, and it will appear to rotate counterclockwise at the\n",
    "new latitude where $f$ is smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12.3 Angular\n",
    "\n",
    "momentum tends to be conserved as columns of water change latitude. This\n",
    "changes the relative vorticity of the columns. After von Arx (1962:\n",
    "110).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:planetaryvorticity\" label=\"fig:planetaryvorticity\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Influence of Vorticity\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of conservation of potential vorticity has far reaching\n",
    "consequences, and its application to fluid flow in the ocean gives a\n",
    "deeper understanding of ocean currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Flow Tends to be Zonal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ocean $f$ tends to be much larger than $\\zeta$ and thus $f/H =$\n",
    "constant. This requires that the flow in an ocean of constant depth be\n",
    "zonal. Of course, depth is not constant, but in general, currents tend\n",
    "to be east-west rather than north south. Wind makes small changes in\n",
    "$\\zeta$, leading to a small meridional component to the flow (see figure\n",
    "11.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Topographic Steering\n",
    "\n",
    "Barotropic flows are diverted by sea floor features. Consider what\n",
    "happens when a flow that extends from the surface to the bottom\n",
    "encounters a sub-sea ridge (figure 12.4). As the depth decreases,\n",
    "$\\zeta + f$ must also decrease, which requires that $f$ decrease, and\n",
    "the flow is turned toward the equator. This is called *topographic\n",
    "steering*. If the change in depth is sufficiently large, no change in\n",
    "latitude will be sufficient to conserve potential vorticity, and the\n",
    "flow will be unable to cross the ridge. This is called *topographic\n",
    "blocking*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12.4 Barotropic\n",
    "\n",
    "flow over a sub-sea ridge is turned equatorward  \n",
    "to conserve potential vorticity. After Dietrich et al. (1980: 333).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:ridgevorticity\" label=\"fig:ridgevorticity\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Western Boundary Currents\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance of vorticity provides an alternate explanation for the\n",
    "existence of western boundary currents. Consider the gyre-scale flow in\n",
    "an ocean basin (figure 12.5), say in the north Atlantic from 10N to 50N.\n",
    "The wind blowing over the Atlantic adds negative vorticity\n",
    "$\\zeta_{\\tau}$. As the water flows around the gyre, the vorticity of the\n",
    "gyre must remain nearly constant, else the flow would spin faster or\n",
    "slower. Overall, the negative vorticity input by the wind must be\n",
    "balanced by a source of positive vorticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout most of the basin the negative vorticity input by the wind is\n",
    "balanced by an increase in relative vorticity. As the flow moves\n",
    "southward throughout the basin, $f$ decreases and $\\zeta$ must increase\n",
    "according to (12.9) because $H$, the depth of the wind-driven\n",
    "circulation, does not change much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance breaks down, however, in the west where the flow returns\n",
    "northward. In the west, $f$ increases, $\\zeta$ decreases, and a source\n",
    "of positive vorticity is needed. The positive vorticity $\\zeta_{b}$ is\n",
    "produced by the western boundary boundary current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 12.5 The balance\n",
    "\n",
    "of potential vorticity can clarify why western boundary currents are\n",
    "necessary. **Left:** Vorticity input by the wind $\\zeta_{\\tau}$ balances\n",
    "the change in relative vorticity $\\zeta$ in the east as the flow moves\n",
    "southward and $f$ decreases. The two do not balance in the west where\n",
    "$\\zeta$ must decrease as the flow moves northward and $f$ increases.\n",
    "**Right:** Vorticity in the west is balanced by relative vorticity\n",
    "$\\zeta_b$ generated by shear in the western boundary current.\n",

    "## Vorticity and Ekman Pumping\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation places another very interesting constraint on the geostrophic\n",
    "flow field. To help understand the constraints, let’s first consider\n",

    "Figure 12.8 An example of how\n",
    "\n",
    "winds produce geostrophic currents running upwind. Ekman transports due\n",
    "to winds in the north Pacific (**Left**) lead to Ekman pumping\n",
    "(**Center**), which sets up north-south pressure gradients in the upper\n",

    "Equatorial Counter Current. <span id=\"fig:zonalmeanwinds\" label=\"fig:zonalmeanwinds\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the water near the surface is warmer than the deeper water, the\n",
    "vertical velocity produces a pool of warm water. Much deeper in the\n",
    "ocean, the wind-driven geostrophic current must go to zero (Sverdrup’s\n",
    "hypothesis) and the deep pressure gradients must be zero. As a result,\n",
    "the surface must dome upward because a column of warm water is longer\n",
    "than a column of cold water having the same weight (they must have the\n",
    "same weight, otherwise, the deep pressure would not be constant, and\n",
    "there would be a deep horizontal pressure gradient). Such a density\n",
    "distribution produces north-south pressure gradients at mid depths that\n",

    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Vorticity strongly constrains ocean dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vorticity due to earth’s rotation is much greater than other sources\n",
    "    of vorticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Taylor and Proudman showed that vertical velocity is impossible in a\n",
    "    uniformly rotating flow. The ocean is rigid in the direction\n",
    "    parallel to the rotation axis. Hence Ekman pumping requires that\n",
    "    planetary vorticity vary with latitude. This explains why Sverdrup\n",
    "    and Stommel found that realistic oceanic circulation, which is\n",
    "    driven by Ekman pumping, requires that $f$ vary with latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The curl of the wind stress adds relative vorticity to central gyres\n",
    "    of each ocean basin. For steady state circulation in the gyre, the\n",
    "    ocean must lose vorticity in western boundary currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Positive wind stress curl leads to divergent flow in the Ekman\n",
    "    layer. The ocean’s interior geostrophic circulation adjusts through\n",
    "    a northward mass transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conservation of absolute vorticity in an ocean with constant density\n",
    "    leads to the conservation of potential vorticity. Thus changes in\n",
    "    depth in an ocean of constant density requires changes of latitude\n",
