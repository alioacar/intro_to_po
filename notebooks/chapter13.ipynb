    "# Deep Circulation in the Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct forcing of the oceanic circulation by wind discussed in the\n",
    "last few chapters is strongest in the upper kilometer of the water\n",
    "column. Below a kilometer lies the vast water masses of the ocean\n",
    "extending to depths of 4–5 km. The water is everywhere cold, with a\n",
    "potential temperature less than 4C. The water mass is formed when cold,\n",
    "dense water sinks from the surface to great depths at high latitudes. It\n",
    "spreads out from these regions to fill the ocean basins. Deep mixing\n",
    "eventually pulls the water up through the thermocline over large areas\n",
    "of the ocean. It is this upward mixing that drives the deep circulation.\n",
    "The vast deep ocean is usually referred to as the *abyss*, and the\n",
    "circulation as the *abyssal circulation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The densest water at the sea surface, water that is dense enough to sink\n",
    "to the bottom, is formed when frigid air blows across the ocean at high\n",
    "latitudes in winter in the Atlantic between Norway and Greenland and\n",
    "near Antarctica. The wind cools and evaporates water. If the wind is\n",
    "cold enough, sea ice forms, further increasing the salinity of the water\n",
    "because ice is fresher than sea water. Bottom water is produced only in\n",
    "these two regions. Cold, dense water is formed in the North Pacific, but\n",
    "it is not salty enough to sink to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "At mid and low latitudes, the density, even in winter, is sufficiently\n",
    "low that the water cannot sink more than a few hundred meters into the\n",
    "ocean. The only exception are some seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea,\n",
    "where evaporation is so great that the salinity of the water is\n",
    "sufficiently great for the water to sink to the bottom of these seas. If\n",
    "these seas can exchange water with the open ocean, the waters formed in\n",
    "winter in the seas mixes with the water in the open ocean and it spreads\n",
    "out along intermediate depths in the open ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many terms have been used to describe the deep circulation. They\n",
    "include: 1) *abyssal circulation*, 2) *thermohaline circulation* 3)\n",
    "*meridional overturning circulation*, and 4) *global conveyor*. The term\n",
    "thermohaline circulation was once widely used, but it has almost\n",
    "entirely disappeared from the oceanographic literature (Toggweiler and\n",
    "Russell, 2008). It is no longer used because it is now clear that the\n",
    "flow is not density driven, and because the concept has not been clearly\n",
    "defined (Wunsch, 2002b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The meridional overturning circulation is better defined. It is the\n",
    "zonal average of the flow plotted as a function of depth and latitude.\n",
    "Plots of the circulation show where vertical flow is important, but they\n",
    "show no information about how circulation in the gyres influences the\n",
    "flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Wunsch (2002b), I define the deep circulation as the\n",
    "circulation of mass. Of course, the mass circulation also carries heat,\n",
    "salt, oxygen, and other properties. But the circulation of the other\n",
    "properties is not the same as the mass transport. For example, Wunsch\n",
    "points out that the north Atlantic imports heat but exports oxygen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep circulation carries heat, salinity, oxygen, CO$_2$, and other\n",
    "properties from high latitudes in winter to lower latitudes throughout\n",
    "the world. This has very important consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contrast between the cold deep water and the warm surface waters\n",
    "determines the stratification of the ocean, which strongly influences\n",
    "ocean dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of deep water is far larger than the volume of surface water.\n",
    "Although currents in the deep ocean are relatively weak, they have\n",
    "transports comparable to the surface transports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluxes of heat and other variables carried by the deep circulation\n",
    "influences earth’s heat budget and climate. The fluxes vary from decades\n",
    "to centuries to millennia, and this variability modulates climate over\n",
    "such time intervals. The ocean may be the primary cause of variability\n",
    "over times ranging from years to decades, and it may have helped\n",
    "modulate ice-age climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two aspects of the deep circulation are especially important for\n",
    "understanding earth’s climate and its possible response to increased\n",
    "carbon dioxide CO$_2$ in the atmosphere: i) the ability of cold water to\n",
    "store CO$_2$ and heat absorbed from the atmosphere, and ii) the ability\n",
    "of deep currents to modulate the heat transported from the tropics to\n",
    "high latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The ocean as a Reservoir of Carbon Dioxide\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean are the primary reservoir of readily available CO$_2$, an\n",
    "important greenhouse gas. The ocean contain 40,000 GtC of dissolved,\n",
    "particulate, and living forms of carbon. The land contains 2,200 GtC,\n",
    "and the atmosphere contains only 750 GtC. Thus the ocean hold 50 times\n",
    "more carbon than the air. Furthermore, the amount of new carbon put into\n",
    "the atmosphere since the industrial revolution, 150 GtC, is less than\n",
    "the amount of carbon cycled through the marine ecosystem in five years.\n",
    "(1 GtC = 1 gigaton of carbon = $10^{12}$ kilograms of carbon.) Carbonate\n",
    "rocks such as limestone, the shells of marine animals, and coral are\n",
    "other, much larger, reservoirs. But this carbon is locked up. It cannot\n",
    "be easily exchanged with carbon in other reservoirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "More CO$_2$ dissolves in cold water than in warm water. Just imagine\n",
    "shaking and opening a hot can of\n",
    "Coke$^{\\mbox{\\textsf{\\scriptsize TM}}}$. The CO$_2$ from a hot can will\n",
    "spew out far faster than from a cold can. Thus the cold deep water in\n",
    "the ocean is the major reservoir of dissolved CO$_2$ in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "New CO$_ 2$ is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and trees\n",
    "are burned. Very quickly, 48% of the CO$_2$ released into the atmosphere\n",
    "dissolves into the ocean (Sabine et al, 2004), much of which ends up\n",
    "deep in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasts of future climate change depend strongly on how much CO$_2$ is\n",
    "stored in the ocean and for how long. If little is stored, or if it is\n",
    "stored and later released into the atmosphere, the concentration in the\n",
    "atmosphere will change, modulating earth’s long-wave radiation balance.\n",
    "How much and how long CO$_2$ is stored in the ocean depends on the\n",
    "transport of CO$_2$ by the deep circulation and on the net flux of\n",
    "carbon deposited on the sea floor. The amount that dissolves depends on\n",
    "the temperature of the deep water, the storage time in the deep ocean\n",
    "depends on the rate at which deep water is replenished, and the\n",
    "deposition depends on whether the dead plants and animals that drop to\n",
    "the sea floor are oxidized. Increased ventilation of deep layers, and\n",
    "warming of the deep layers could release large quantities of the gas to\n",
    "the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage of carbon in the ocean also depends on the dynamics of\n",
    "marine ecosystems, upwelling, and the amount of dead plants and animals\n",
    "stored in sediments. But I won’t consider these processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Oceanic Transport of Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean carry about half the heat out of the tropics needed to\n",
    "maintain earth’s temperature. Heat carried by the Gulf Stream and the\n",
    "north Atlantic drift keeps the far north Atlantic ice free, and it helps\n",
    "warm Europe. Norway, at 60N is far warmer than southern Greenland or\n",
    "northern Labrador at the same latitude. Palm trees grow on the west\n",
    "coast of Ireland, but not in Newfoundland which is further south.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wally Broecker (1987), working at Lamont-Doherty Geophysical Observatory\n",
    "of Columbia University, calls the oceanic component of the\n",
    "heat-transport system the *Global Conveyor Belt*. The basic idea is that\n",
    "surface currents carry heat to the far north Atlantic (figure 13.1).\n",
    "There the surface water releases heat and water to the atmosphere, and\n",
    "it becomes sufficiently cold, salty, and dense that it sinks to the\n",
    "bottom in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas. It then flows southward in\n",
    "cold, bottom currents. Some of the water remains on the surface and\n",
    "returns to the south in cool surface currents such as the Labrador\n",
    "Current and Portugal Current (see figure 11.8). Richardson (2008) has\n",
    "written a very useful paper surveying our understanding of the global\n",
    "conveyor belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep bottom water from the north Atlantic is mixed upward in other\n",
    "regions and ocean, and eventually it makes its way back to the Gulf\n",
    "Stream and the North Atlantic. Thus most of the water that sinks in the\n",
    "north Atlantic must be replaced by water from the far south Atlantic. As\n",
    "this surface water moves northward across the equator and eventually\n",
    "into the Gulf Stream, it carries heat out of the south Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So much heat is pulled northward by the formation of north Atlantic\n",
    "bottom water in winter that heat transport in the Atlantic is entirely\n",
    "northward, even in the southern hemisphere (figure 5.11). Much of the\n",
    "solar heat absorbed by the tropical Atlantic is shipped north to warm\n",
    "Europe and the northern hemisphere. Imagine then what might happen if\n",
    "the supply of heat is shut off. I will get back to that topic in the\n",
    "next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.1 The surface (narrow dashes)\n",
    "\n",
    "and deep (wide dashes) currents in the north Atlantic. The North\n",
    "Atlantic Current brings warm water northward where it cools. Some sinks\n",
    "and returns southward as a cold, deep, western-boundary current. Some\n",
    "returns southward at the surface. From Woods Hole Oceanographic\n",
    "Institution. <span id=\"fig:fig13-1\" label=\"fig:fig13-1\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a crude estimate of the importance of the north Atlantic\n",
    "surface and deep circulation from a calculation based on what we know\n",
    "about waters in the Atlantic compiled by Bill Schmitz (1996) in his\n",
    "wonderful summary of his life’s work. The Gulf Stream carries 40 Sv of\n",
    "18C water northward. Of this, 14 Sv return southward in the deep western\n",
    "boundary current at a temperature of 2C. The water must therefore lose\n",
    "0.9 petawatts (1 petawatt $= 10^{15}$ watt) in the north Atlantic north\n",
    "of 24N. Although the calculation is very crude, it is remarkably close\n",
    "to the value of $1.2\\,\\pm\\,0.2$ petawatts estimated much more carefully\n",
    "by Rintoul and Wunsch (1991).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the water remained on the surface and returned as an\n",
    "eastern boundary current, it would be far warmer than the deep current\n",
    "when it returned southward. Hence, the heat transport would be much\n",
    "reduced and it would probably not keep the far north Atlantic ice free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of bottom water is influenced by the surface salinity and\n",
    "winds in the north Atlantic (Toggweiler and Russell, 2008). It is also\n",
    "influenced by the rate of upwelling due to mixing in other oceanic\n",
    "areas. First, let’s look at the influence of salinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saltier surface waters form denser water in winter than less salty\n",
    "water. At first you may think that temperature is also important, but at\n",
    "high latitudes water in all ocean basins gets cold enough to freeze, so\n",
    "all ocean produce $-2$C water at the surface. Of this, only the most\n",
    "salty will sink, and the saltiest water is in the Atlantic and under the\n",
    "ice on the continental shelves around Antarctica.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of bottom water is remarkably sensitive to small changes\n",
    "in salinity. Rahmstorf (1995), using a numerical model of the meridional\n",
    "overturning circulation, showed that a $\\pm$<!-- -->0.1Sv\n",
    "variation of the flow of fresh water into the north Atlantic can switch\n",
    "on or off the deep circulation of 14 Sv. If the deep-water production is\n",
    "shut off during times of low salinity, the 1 petawatt of heat may also\n",
    "be shut off. Weaver and Hillaire-Marcel (2004) point out that the\n",
    "shutdown of the production of bottom water is unlikely, and if it did\n",
    "happen, it would lead to a colder Europe, not a new ice age, because of\n",
    "the higher concentrations of CO$_2$ now in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "I write *may be shut off* because the ocean is a very complex system. We\n",
    "don’t know if other processes will increase heat transport if the deep\n",
    "circulation is disturbed. For example, the circulation at intermediate\n",
    "depths may increase when deep circulation is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production of bottom water is also remarkably sensitive to small\n",
    "changes in mixing in the deep ocean. Munk and Wunsch (1998) calculate\n",
    "that 2.1 TW (terawatts $= 10^{12}$ watts) are required to drive the deep\n",
    "circulation, and that this small source of mechanical mixing drives a\n",
    "poleward heat flux of 2000 TW. Some of the energy for mixing comes from\n",
    "winds which can produce turbulent mixing throughout the ocean. Some\n",
    "energy comes from the dissipation of tidal currents, which depend on the\n",
    "distribution of the continents. Some of the energy comes from the flow\n",
    "of deep water past the mid-ocean ridge system. Thus during the last ice\n",
    "age, when sea level was much lower, tides, tidal currents, tidal\n",
    "dissipation, winds, and deep circulation all differed from present\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Role of the Ocean in Ice-Age Climate Fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "What might happen if the production of deep water in the Atlantic is\n",
    "shut off? Information contained in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets,\n",
    "in north Atlantic sediments, and in lake sediments provide important\n",
    "clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several ice cores through the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets provide\n",
    "a continuous record of atmospheric conditions over Greenland and\n",
    "Antarctica extending back more than 700,000 years before the present in\n",
    "some cores. Annual layers in the core are counted to get age. Deeper in\n",
    "the core, where annual layers are hard to see, age is calculated from\n",
    "depth and from dust layers from well-dated volcanic eruptions.\n",
    "Oxygen-isotope ratios of the ice give air temperature at the glacier\n",
    "surface when the ice was formed. Deuterium concentrations give\n",
    "ocean-surface temperature at the moisture source region. Bubbles in the\n",
    "ice give atmospheric CO$_2$ and methane concentration. Pollen, chemical\n",
    "composition, and particles give information about volcanic eruptions,\n",
    "wind speed, and direction. Thickness of annual layers gives snow\n",
    "accumulation rates. And isotopes of some elements give solar and cosmic\n",
    "ray activity (Alley, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cores through deep-sea sediments in the north Atlantic made by the Ocean\n",
    "Drilling Program give information about i) surface and deep temperatures\n",
    "and salinity at the location of above the core, ii) the production of\n",
    "north Atlantic deep water, iii) ice volume in glaciers, and iv)\n",
    "production of icebergs. Ice-sheet and deep-sea cores have allowed\n",
    "reconstructions of climate for the past few hundred thousand years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oxygen-isotope and deuterium records in the ice cores show abrupt\n",
    "climate variability many times over the past 700,000 years. Many times\n",
    "during the last ice age temperatures near Greenland warmed rapidly over\n",
    "periods of 1–100 years, followed by gradual cooling over longer\n",
    "periods. (Dansgaard et al, 1993). For example, $\\approx 11,500$ years\n",
    "ago, temperatures over Greenland warmed by $\\approx 8$C in 40 years in\n",
    "three steps, each spanning 5 years (Alley, 2000). Such abrupt warming is\n",
    "called a Dansgaard/Oeschger event. Other studies have shown that much of\n",
    "the northern hemisphere warmed and cooled in phase with temperatures\n",
    "calculated from the ice core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The climate of the past 8,000 years was constant with very little\n",
    "variability. Our perception of climate change is thus based on highly\n",
    "unusual circumstances. All of recorded history has been during a period\n",
    "of warm and stable climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hartmut Heinrich and colleagues (Bond et al. 1992), studying the\n",
    "sediments in the north Atlantic found periods when coarse material was\n",
    "deposited on the bottom in mid ocean. Only icebergs can carry such\n",
    "material out to sea, and the find indicated times when large numbers of\n",
    "icebergs were released into the north Atlantic. These are now called\n",
    "Heinrich events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.2 Periodic\n",
    "\n",
    "surges of icebergs during the last ice age appear to have modulated\n",
    "temperatures of the northern hemisphere by lowering the salinity of the\n",
    "far north Atlantic and reducing the meridional overturning circulation.\n",
    "Data from cores through the Greenland ice sheet (1), deep-sea sediments\n",
    "(2,3), and alpine-lake sediments (4) indicate that: **Left:** During\n",
    "recent times the circulation has been stable, and the polar front which\n",
    "separates warm and cold water masses has allowed warm water to penetrate\n",
    "beyond Norway. **Center:** During the last ice age, periodic surges of\n",
    "icebergs reduced salinity and reduced the meridional overturning\n",
    "circulation, causing the polar front to move southward and keeping warm\n",
    "water south of Spain. **Right:** Similar fluctuations during the last\n",
    "interglacial appear to have caused rapid, large changes in climate. The\n",
    "**Bottom** plot is a rough indication of temperature in the region, but\n",
    "the scales are not the same. After Zahn (1994). <span id=\"fig:NAiceage\" label=\"fig:NAiceage\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.3 The\n",
    "\n",
    "meridional-overturning circulation in the north Atlantic may be stable\n",
    "near *2* and *4*. But, the switching from a warm, salty regime to a\n",
    "cold, fresh regime and back has hysteresis. This means that as the warm\n",
    "salty ocean in an initial state *1* freshens, and becomes more fresh\n",
    "than *2* it quickly switches to a cold, fresh state *3*. When the area\n",
    "again becomes salty, it must move past state *4* before it can switch\n",
    "back to *1*. <span id=\"fig:hysteresis\" label=\"fig:hysteresis\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation of Greenland temperature with iceberg production is\n",
    "related to the deep circulation. When icebergs melted, the surge of\n",
    "fresh water increased the stability of the water column shutting off the\n",
    "production of north Atlantic Deep Water. The shut-off of deep-water\n",
    "formation greatly reduced the northward transport of warm water into the\n",
    "north Atlantic, producing very cold northern hemisphere climate (figure\n",
    "13.2). The melting of the ice pushed the polar front, the boundary\n",
    "between cold and warm water in the north Atlantic further south than its\n",
    "present position. The location of the front, and the time it was at\n",
    "different positions can be determined from analysis of bottom sediments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the meridional overturning circulation shuts down, heat normally\n",
    "carried from the south Atlantic to the north Atlantic becomes available\n",
    "to warm the southern hemisphere. This results in a climate ‘sea-saw’\n",
    "between northern and southern hemispheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The switching on and off of the deep circulation has large hysteresis\n",
    "(figure 13.3). The circulation has two stable states. The first is the\n",
    "present circulation. In the second, deep water is produced mostly near\n",
    "Antarctica, and upwelling occurs in the far north Pacific (as it does\n",
    "today) and in the far north Atlantic. Once the circulation is shut off,\n",
    "the system switches to the second stable state. The return to normal\n",
    "salinity does not cause the circulation to turn on. Surface waters must\n",
    "become saltier than average for the first state to return (Rahmstorf,\n",
    "1995).\n",
    "\n",
    "Heinrich events seem to precede the largest Dansgaard/Oeschger events\n",
    "(Stocker and Marchal, 2000). Here’s what seems to happen. The Heinrich\n",
    "event shuts off the Atlantic deep circulation which leads to a very cold\n",
    "north Atlantic (Martrat et al, 2007). This is followed about 1000 years\n",
    "later by a Dansgaard/Oeschger event with rapid warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dansgaard/Oeschger–Heinrich tandem events have global influence, and\n",
    "they are related to warming events seen in Antarctic ice cores.\n",
    "Temperatures changes in the two hemispheres are out of phase. When\n",
    "Greenland warms, Antarctica cools. Recent data from the European Project\n",
    "for Ice Coring in Antarctica (<span class=\"smallcaps\">epica</span>) shows that in the\n",
    "period between 20,000 and 90,000 years ago, 40% of the variance in the\n",
    "Greenland temperature data can be explained by Antarctic temperature\n",
    "data (Steig, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "A weakened version of this process with a period of about 1000 years may\n",
    "be modulating present-day climate in the north Atlantic, and it may have\n",
    "been responsible for the Little Ice Age from 1100 to 1800.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between variations in salinity, air temperature,\n",
    "deep-water formation, and the atmospheric circulation is not yet\n",
    "understood. For example, we don’t know if changes in the atmospheric\n",
    "circulation trigger changes in the meridional overturning circulation,\n",
    "or if changes in the meridional overturning circulation trigger changes\n",
    "in the atmospheric circulation (Brauer et al, 2008). Furthermore, surges\n",
    "may result from warmer temperatures caused by increased water vapor from\n",
    "the tropics (a greenhouse gas) or from an internal instability of a\n",
    "large ice sheet. We do know, however, that climate can change very\n",
    "abruptly, and that circulation in the northern hemisphere has a very\n",
    "sensitive threshold, that when crossed, causes large changes in the\n",
    "circulation pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Steffensen (2008) found that 11,704, 12,896, and 14,694\n",
    "years before 2000 <span class=\"smallcaps\">ad</span> the temperature of the source water\n",
    "for Greenland precipitation warmed 2–4C in 1–3 years. This indicates a\n",
    "very rapid reorganization of the atmospheric circulation at high\n",
    "latitudes in the northern hemisphere and a shift in the location of the\n",
    "source region. During the earliest event air temperature over Greenland\n",
    "warmed by $\\approx$ 10C in 3 years. At the later events, air temperature\n",
    "over Greenland changed more slowly, over 60 to 200 years. Brauer et al\n",
    "(2008) found an abrupt change in storminess over Germany at almost\n",
    "exactly the same time, 12,679 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory for the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Stommel, Arons, and Faller in a series of papers from 1958 to 1960\n",
    "described a simple theory of the abyssal circulation (Stommel 1958;\n",
    "Stommel, Arons, and Faller, 1958; Stommel and Arons, 1960). The theory\n",
    "differed so greatly from what was expected that Stommel and Arons\n",
    "devised laboratory experiments with rotating fluids to confirmed their\n",
    "theory. The theory for the deep circulation has been further discussed\n",
    "by Marotzke (2000) and Munk and Wunsch (1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stommel, Arons, Faller theory is based on three fundamental ideas:\n",
    "\n",

    "of cold water at high latitudes. Munk and Wunsch (1998) point out that\n",
    "deep convection by itself leads to a deep, stagnant, pool of cold water.\n",
    "In this case, the deep circulation is confined to the upper layers of\n",

    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:stommeldeep\" label=\"fig:stommeldeep\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect the streamlines of the flow in the west, Stommel added a deep\n",
    "western boundary current. The strength of the western boundary current\n",
    "depends on the volume of water $S$ produced at the source regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stommel and Arons calculated the flow for a simplified ocean bounded by\n",
    "the Equator and two meridians (a pie shaped ocean). First they placed\n",
    "the source $S_0$ near the pole to approximate the flow in the north\n",
    "Atlantic. If the volume of water sinking at the source equals the volume\n",
    "of water upwelled in the basin, and if the upwelled velocity is constant\n",
    "everywhere, then the transport $T_w$ in the western boundary current is:\n",
    "$$T_w = -2\\,S_0 \\sin \\varphi$$ The transport in the western boundary\n",
    "current at the poles is twice the volume of the source, and the\n",
    "transport diminishes to zero at the Equator (Stommel and Arons, 1960a:\n",
    "eq, 7.3.15; see also Pedlosky, 1996: §7.3). The flow driven by the\n",
    "upwelling water adds a recirculation equal to the source. If $S_0$\n",
    "exceeds the volume of water upwelled in the basin, then the western\n",
    "boundary current carries water across the Equator. This gives the\n",
    "western boundary current sketched in the north Atlantic in figure 13.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Stommel and Arons calculated the transport in a western boundary\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Some Comments on the Theory for the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of the deep circulation is still evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marotzke and Scott (1999) points out that deep convection and mixing are\n",
    "very different processes. Convection reduces the potential energy of the\n",
    "water column, and it is self powered. Mixing in a stratified fluid\n",
    "increases the potential energy, and it must be driven by an external\n",
    "process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical models show that the deep circulation is very sensitive to the\n",
    "assumed value of vertical eddy diffusivity in the thermocline (Gargett\n",
    "and Holloway, 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical calculations by Marotzke and Scott (1999) indicate that the\n",
    "mass transport is not limited by the rate of deep convection, but it is\n",
    "sensitive to the assumed value of vertical eddy diffusivity, especially\n",
    "near side boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cold water is mixed upward at the ocean’s boundaries, above seamounts\n",
    "and mid-ocean ridges, along strong currents such as the Gulf Stream, and\n",
    "in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Toggweiler and Russell, 2008;\n",
    "Garabato et al, 2004, 2007). Because mixing is strong over mid-ocean\n",
    "ridges and small in nearby areas, flow is zonal in the ocean basins and\n",
    "poleward along the ridges (Hogg et al. 2001). A map of the circulation\n",
    "will not look like figure 13.4. Numerical models and measurements of\n",
    "deep flow by floats show the flow is indeed zonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the transport of mass, heat, and salt are not closely related\n",
    "the transport of heat into the north Atlantic may not be as sensitive to\n",
    "surface salinity as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations of the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The abyssal circulation is less well known than the upper-ocean\n",
    "circulation. Direct observations from moored current meters or\n",
    "deep-drifting floats were difficult to make until recently, and there\n",
    "are few long-term direct measurements of current. In addition, the\n",
    "measurements do not produce a stable mean value for the deep currents.\n",
    "For example, if the deep circulation takes roughly 1,000 years to\n",
    "transport water from the north Atlantic to the Antarctic Circumpolar\n",
    "Current and then to the north Pacific, the mean flow is about 1 mm/s.\n",
    "Observing this small mean flow in the presence of typical deep currents\n",
    "having variable velocities of up to 10 cm/s or greater, is very\n",
    "difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our knowledge of the deep circulation is inferred from measured\n",
    "distribution of water masses with their distinctive temperature and\n",
    "salinity and their concentrations of oxygen, silicate, tritium,\n",
    "fluorocarbons and other tracers. These measurements are much more stable\n",
    "than direct current measurements, and observations made decades apart\n",
    "can be used to trace the circulation. Tomczak (1999) carefully describes\n",
    "how the techniques can be made quantitative and how they can be applied\n",
    "in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water Masses\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of water masses originates in meteorology. Vilhelm Bjerknes,\n",
    "a Norwegian meteorologist, first described the cold air masses that form\n",
    "in the polar regions. He showed how they move southward, where they\n",
    "collide with warm air masses at places he called fronts, just as masses\n",
    "of troops collide at fronts in war (Friedman, 1989). In a similar way,\n",
    "water masses are formed in different regions of the ocean, and the water\n",
    "masses are often separated by fronts. Note, however, that strong winds\n",
    "are associated with fronts in the atmosphere because of the large\n",
    "difference in density and temperature on either side of the front.\n",
    "Fronts in the ocean sometimes have little contrast in density, and these\n",
    "fronts have only weak currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomczak (1999) defines a *water mass* as a\n",
    "\n",
    "> body of water with a common formation history, having its origin in a\n",
    "> physical region of the ocean. Just as air masses in the atmosphere,\n",
    "> water masses are physical entities with a measurable volume and\n",
    "> therefore occupy a finite volume in the ocean. In their formation\n",
    "> region they have exclusive occupation of a particular part of the\n",
    "> ocean. Elsewhere they share the ocean with other water masses with\n",
    "> which they mix. The total volume of a water mass is given by the sum\n",
    "> of all its elements regardless of their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.6 Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "and salinity measured at hydrographic stations on either side of the\n",
    "Gulf Stream. Data are from tables 10.2 and 10.4. **Left:** Temperature\n",
    "and salinity plotted as a function of depth. **Right:** The same data,\n",
    "but salinity is plotted as a function of temperature in a *T-S* plot.\n",
    "Notice that temperature and salinity are uniquely related below the\n",
    "mixed layer. A few depths are noted next to data points.\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:GulfStreamTSDPlot\" label=\"fig:GulfStreamTSDPlot\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Plots of salinity as a function of temperature, called *T-S* plots, are\n",
    "used to delineate water masses and their geographical distribution, to\n",
    "describe mixing among water masses, and to infer motion of water in the\n",
    "deep ocean. Here’s why the plots are so useful: water properties, such\n",
    "as temperature and salinity, are formed only when the water is at the\n",
    "surface or in the mixed layer. Heating, cooling, rain, and evaporation\n",
    "all contribute. Once the water sinks below the mixed layer temperature\n",
    "and salinity can change only by mixing with adjacent water masses. Thus\n",
    "water from a particular region has a particular temperature associated\n",
    "with a particular salinity, and the relationship changes little as the\n",
    "water moves through the deep ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus temperature and salinity are not independent variables. For\n",
    "example, the temperature and salinity of the water at different depths\n",
    "below the Gulf Stream are uniquely related (figure 13.6, right),\n",
    "indicating they came from the same source region, even though they do\n",
    "not appear related if temperature and salinity are plotted independently\n",
    "as a function of depth (figure 13.6, left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature and salinity are *conservative properties* because there are\n",
    "no sources or sinks of heat and salt in the interior of the ocean. Other\n",
    "properties, such as oxygen are non-conservative. For example, oxygen\n",
    "content may change slowly due to oxidation of organic material and\n",
    "respiration by animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point in the *T-S* plot is a *water type*. This is a mathematical\n",
    "ideal. Some water masses may be very homogeneous and they are almost\n",
    "points on the plot. Other water masses are less homogeneous, and they\n",
    "occupy regions on the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.7 **Upper:** Mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "of two water masses produces a line on a *T-S* plot. **Lower:** Mixing\n",
    "among three water masses produces intersecting lines on a *T-S* plot,\n",
    "and the apex at the intersection is rounded by further mixing. After\n",
    "Defant (1961: 205). <span id=\"fig:TSsketch\" label=\"fig:TSsketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixing two water types leads to a straight line on a *T-S* diagram\n",
    "(figure 13.7). Because the lines of constant density on a *T-S* plot are\n",
    "curved, mixing increases the density of the water. This is called\n",
    "*densification* (figure 13.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water Masses and the Deep Circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use these ideas of water masses and mixing to study the deep\n",
    "circulation. We start in the south Atlantic because it has very clearly\n",
    "defined water masses. A *T-S* plot calculated from hydrographic data\n",
    "collected in the south Atlantic (figure 13.9) shows three important\n",
    "water masses listed in order of decreasing depth (table 13.1): Antarctic\n",
    "Bottom Water <span class=\"smallcaps\">aab</span>, North Atlantic Deep Water\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">nadw</span>, and Antarctic Intermediate Water <span class=\"smallcaps\">aiw</span>.\n",
    "All are deeper than one kilometer. The mixing among three water masses\n",
    "shows the characteristic rounded apexes shown in the idealized case\n",
    "shown in figure 13.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot indicates that the same water masses can be found throughout\n",
    "the western basins in the south Atlantic. Now let’s use a cross section\n",
    "of salinity to trace the movement of the water masses using the core\n",
    "method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 13.8 Mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "of two water types of the same density(L and G) produces water that is\n",
    "denser (M) than either water type. After Tolmazin (1985: 137).\n",

    "<span id=\"fig:densification\" label=\"fig:densification\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Core Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The slow variation from place to place in the ocean of a tracer such as\n",
    "salinity can be used to determine the source of the waters masses such\n",
    "as those in figure 13.9. This is called the *core method*. The method\n",
    "may also be used to track the slow movement of the water mass. Note,\n",
    "however, that a slow drift of the water and horizontal mixing both\n",

    "A *core* is a layer of water with extreme value (in the mathematical\n",

    "value is a local maximum or minimum of the quantity as a function of\n",
    "depth. The method assumes that the flow is along the core. Water in the\n",

    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is probably not along the arrows shown in figure 13.10. The\n",
    "distribution of properties in the abyss can be explained by a\n",
    "combination of slow flow in the direction of the arrows plus horizontal\n",
    "mixing along surfaces of constant potential density with some weak\n",
    "vertical mixing. The vertical mixing probably occurs at the places where\n",
    "the density surface reaches the sea bottom at a lateral boundary such as\n",
    "seamounts, mid-ocean ridges, and along the western boundary. Flow in a\n",
    "plane perpendicular to that of the figure may be at least as strong as\n",
    "the flow in the plane of the figure shown by the arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core method can be applied only to a tracer that does not influence\n",
    "density. Hence temperature is usually a poor choice. If the tracer\n",
    "controls density, then flow will be around the core according to ideas\n",
    "of geostrophy, not along core as assumed by the core method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core method works especially well in the south Atlantic with its\n",
    "clearly defined water masses. In other ocean basins, the *T-S*\n",
    "relationship is more complicated. The abyssal waters in the other basins\n",
    "are a complex mixture of waters coming from different areas in the ocean\n",
    "(figure 13.11). For example, warm, salty water from the Mediterranean\n",
    "Sea enters the north Atlantic and spreads out at intermediate depths\n",

    "concentration is very small; it is conserved, which means that only\n",

    "Salinity is conserved, and it influences density much less than\n",

    "A plot of density across a line of constant longitude in the Drake\n",
    "Passage (figure 13.12) shows three fronts. They are, from north to\n",
    "south: 1) the Subantarctic Front, 2) the Polar Front, and 3) the\n",
    "Southern <span class=\"smallcaps\">acc</span> Front. Each front is continuous around\n",
    "Antarctica (figure 13.13). The plot also shows that the constant-density\n",
    "surfaces slope at all depths, which indicates that the currents extend\n",
    "to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical current speeds are around 10 cm/s with speeds of up to 50 cm/s\n",
    "near some fronts. Although the currents are slow, they transport much\n",
    "more water than western boundary currents because the flow is deep and\n",
    "wide. Whitworth and Peterson (1985) calculated transport through the\n",
    "Drake Passage using several years of data from an array of 91 current\n",
    "meters on 24 moorings spaced approximately 50 km apart along a line\n",
    "spanning the passage. They also used measurements of bottom pressure\n",
    "measured by gauges on either side of the passage. They found that the\n",
    "average transport through the Drake Passage was $125 \\pm 11$ Sv, and\n",
    "that the transport varied from 95 Sv to 158 Sv. The maximum transport\n",
    "tended to occur in late winter and early spring (figure 13.14).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the antarctic currents reach the bottom, they are influenced by\n",
    "topographic steering. As the current crosses ridges such as the\n",
    "Kerguelen Plateau, the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, and the Drake Passage,\n",
    "it is deflected by the ridges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the current is composed of Circumpolar Deep Water, a mixture\n",
    "of deep water from all ocean. The upper branch of the current contains\n",
    "oxygen-poor water from all ocean. The lower (deeper) branch contains a\n",
    "core of high-salinity water from the Atlantic, including contributions\n",
    "from the north Atlantic deep water mixed with salty Mediterranean Sea\n",
    "water. As the different water masses circulate around Antarctica they\n",
    "mix with other water masses with similar density. In a sense, the\n",
    "current is a giant ‘mix-master’ taking deep water from each ocean,\n",
    "mixing it with deep water from other ocean, and then redistributing it\n",
    "back to each ocean (Garabato et al, 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "The coldest, saltiest water in the ocean is produced on the continental\n",
    "shelf around Antarctica in winter, mostly from the shallow Weddell and\n",
    "Ross seas. The cold salty water drains from the shelves, entrains some\n",
    "deep water, and spreads out along the sea floor. Eventually, 8–10 Sv of\n",
    "bottom water are formed (Orsi, Johnson, and Bullister, 1999). This dense\n",
    "water then seeps into all the ocean basins. By definition, this water is\n",
    "too dense to cross through the Drake Passage, so it is not circumpolar\n",
    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Antarctic currents are wind driven. Strong west winds with maximum\n",
    "speed near 50S drive the currents (see figure 4.2), and the north-south\n",
    "gradient of wind speed produces convergence and divergence of Ekman\n",
    "transports. Divergence south of the zone of maximum wind speed, south of\n",
    "50S leads to upwelling of the Circumpolar Deep Water. Convergence north\n",
    "of the zone of maximum winds leads to downwelling of the Antarctic\n",
    "intermediate water. The surface water is relatively fresh but cold, and\n",
    "when they sink they define characteristics of the Antarctic intermediate\n",
    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of the circumpolar current relative to the maximum of the\n",
    "westerly winds influences the meridional overturning circulation and\n",
    "climate. North of the maximum, Ekman transports converge, pushing water\n",
    "downward into the Antarctic Intermediate Water north of the Polar Front.\n",
    "South of the maximum winds, Ekman transports diverge, pulling\n",
    "Circumpolar Atlantic Deep Water to the surface south of the Polar Front,\n",
    "which helps drive the deep circulation (figure 13.10). When the maximum\n",
    "winds are further from the pole, less deep water is pulled upward, and\n",
    "the deep circulation is weak, as it was during the last ice age. As the\n",
    "earth warmed after the ice age, the maximum winds shifted south. The\n",
    "winds were more aligned with the Circumpolar Current, and they pulled\n",
    "more deep water to the surface. Since 1960, the winds have strengthened\n",
    "and shifted southward, further strengthening Circumpolar Current and the\n",
    "deep circulation Toggweiler and Russell, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because wind constantly transfers momentum to the Antarctic Circumpolar\n",
    "Current, causing it to accelerate, the acceleration must be balanced by\n",
    "drag, and we are led to ask: What keeps the flow from accelerating to\n",
    "very high speeds? Munk and Palmen (1951), suggest form drag dominates.\n",
    "Form drag is due to the current crossing sub-sea ridges, especially at\n",
    "the Drake Passage. Form drag is also the drag of the wind on a fast\n",
    "moving car. In both cases, the flow is diverted, by the ridge or by your\n",
    "car, creating a low pressure zone downstream of the ridge or down wind\n",
    "of the car. The low pressure zone transfers momentum into the solid\n",
    "earth, slowing down the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The deep circulation of the ocean is very important because it\n",
    "    determines the vertical stratification of the ocean and because it\n",
    "    modulates climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ocean absorbs CO$_2$ from the atmosphere reducing atmospheric\n",
    "    CO$_2$ concentrations. The deep circulation carries the CO$_2$ deep\n",
    "    into the ocean temporarily keeping it from returning to the\n",
    "    atmosphere. Eventually, however, most of the CO$_2$ must be released\n",
    "    back to the atmosphere. But, some remains in the ocean.\n",
    "    Phytoplankton convert CO$_2$ into organic carbon, some of which\n",
    "    sinks to the sea floor and is buried in sediments. Some CO$_2$ is\n",
    "    used to make sea shells, and it too remains in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The production of deep bottom waters in the north Atlantic draws a\n",
    "    petawatt of heat into the northern hemisphere which helps warm\n",
    "    Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variability of deep water formation in the north Atlantic has been\n",
    "    tied to large fluctuations of northern hemisphere temperature during\n",
    "    the last ice ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Deep convection which produces bottom water occurs only in the far\n",
    "    north Atlantic and at a few locations around Antarctica.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The deep circulation is driven by vertical mixing, which is largest\n",
    "    above mid-ocean ridges, near seamounts, and in strong boundary\n",
    "    currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The deep circulation is too weak to measure directly. It is inferred\n",
    "    from observations of water masses defined by their temperature and\n",
    "    salinity and from observation of tracers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Antarctic Circumpolar Current mixes deep water from the\n",
    "    Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean and redistributes it back to\n",
    "    each ocean. The current is deep and slow with a transport of 125 Sv."
