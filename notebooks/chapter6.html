<h1><span class="section-number">6. </span>Temperature, Salinity, and Density<a class="headerlink" href="#temperature-salinity-and-density" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Heat fluxes, evaporation, rain, river inflow, and freezing and melting
of sea ice all influence the distribution of temperature and salinity at
the ocean’s surface. Changes in temperature and salinity can increase or
decrease the density of water at the surface, which can lead to
convection. If water from the surface sinks into the deeper ocean, it
retains a distinctive relationship between temperature and salinity
which helps oceanographers track the movement of deep water. In
addition, temperature, salinity, and pressure are used to calculate
density. The distribution of density inside the ocean is directly
related to the distribution of horizontal pressure gradients and ocean
currents. For all these reasons, we need to know the distribution of
temperature, salinity, and density in the ocean.</p>
<p>Before discussing the distribution of temperature and salinity, let’s
first define what we mean by the terms, especially salinity.</p>
<section id="definition-of-salinity">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.1. </span>Definition of Salinity<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-salinity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>At the simplest level, salinity is the total amount of dissolved
material in grams in one kilogram of sea water. Thus salinity is a
dimensionless quantity. It has no units. The variability of dissolved
salt is very small, and we must be very careful to define salinity in
ways that are accurate and practical. To better understand the need for
accuracy, look at <a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-1"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.1</span></a>. Notice that the range of salinity for most
of the ocean’s water is from 34.60 to 34.80 parts per thousand, which is
200 parts per million. The variability in the deep North Pacific is even
smaller, about 20 parts per million. If we want to classify water with
different salinity, we need definitions and instruments accurate to
about one part per million. Notice that the range of temperature is much
larger, about 1, and temperature is easier to measure.</p>
<p>Writing a practical definition of salinity that has useful accuracy is
difficult (see Lewis <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id91" title="E. L. Lewis. The practical salinity scale 1978 and its antecedents. IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, OE-5:3–8, 1980.">90</a>]</span>,for the details), and various definitions
have been used.</p>

<p>Originally salinity was defined to be the “Total amount of dissolved
material in grams in one kilogram of sea water.” This is not useful
because the dissolved material is almost impossible to measure in
practice. For example, how do we measure volatile material like gasses?
Nor can we evaporate sea-water to dryness because chlorides are lost in
the last stages of drying (Sverdrup, Johnson, and Fleming, <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id23" title="H. U. Sverdrup, M. W. Johnson, and R. H. Fleming.

<p>To avoid these difficulties, the International Council for the
Exploration of the Sea set up a commission in 1889 which recommended
that salinity be defined as the “Total amount of solid materials in
grams dissolved in one kilogram of sea water when all the carbonate has
been converted to oxide, the bromine and iodine replaced by chlorine and
all organic matter completely oxidized.” The definition was published in
1902. <em>This is useful but difficult to use routinely</em>.</p>

<p>Because the above definition was difficult to implement in practice,
because salinity is directly proportional to the amount of chlorine in
sea water, and because chlorine can be measured accurately by a simple
chemical analysis, salinity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> was redefined using chlorinity:</p>

<p>As more and more accurate measurements were made, equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq6-1">(6.1)</a> turned out to be
too inaccurate. In 1964 <span class="small">UNESCO</span> and other international

recommended in 1966 (Wooster, Lee, and Dietrich <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id93" title="W. S. Wooster, A. J. Lee, and G. Dietrich. Redefinition of salinity. Deep-Sea Research, 16(3):321–322, 1969.">92</a>]</span>) that salinity and

<p>The Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 introduced several small problems.
It led to confusion about units and to the use of “practical salinity
units” that are not part of the definition of Practical Salinity. In
addition, absolute salinity differs from salinity by about 0.5%. And,
the composition of seawater differs slightly from place to place in the
ocean, leading to small errors in measuring salinity.</p>
<p>To avoid these and other problems, Millero et al. <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id98" title="F. J. Millero, R. Feistel, and others. The composition of standard seawater and the definition of the reference-composition salinity scale.

measure of salinity, the Reference Salinity, that accurately represents
the Absolute Salinity of an artificial seawater solution. It is based on
a Reference Composition of seawater that is much more accurate than the
values in <a class="reference internal" href="#table6-1"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6.1</span></a> above. The <em>Reference Composition</em> of the artificial
seawater is defined by a list of solutes and their mole fractions given
in Table 4 of their paper. From this, they defined artificial <em>Reference
Seawater</em> to be seawater having a Reference Composition solute dissolved
in pure water as the solvent, and adjusted to its thermodynamic
equilibrium state. Finally, the <em>Reference Salinity</em> of Reference
Seawater was defined to be exactly 35.16504 g kg<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Many physical processes depend on temperature. A few can be used to
define absolute temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span>. The unit of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> is the kelvin, which
has the symbol K. The fundamental processes used for defining an
absolute temperature scale over the range of temperatures found in the
ocean include (Soulen and Fogle <span id="id15">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id99" title="R. J. Soulen and W. E. Fogle. Temperature scales below 1 kelvin. Physics Today, 50(8 Part 1):36–42, 1997.">98</a>]</span>): 1) the gas laws relating
pressure to temperature of an ideal gas with corrections for the density
of the gas; and 2) the voltage noise of a resistance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>The measurement of temperature using an absolute scale is difficult and
the measurement is usually made by national standards laboratories. The
absolute measurements are used to define a practical temperature scale
based on the temperature of a few fixed points and interpolating devices
which are calibrated at the fixed points.</p>
<p>For temperatures commonly found in the ocean, the interpolating device
is a platinum-resistance thermometer. It consists of a loosely wound,
strain-free, pure platinum wire whose resistance is a function of
temperature. It is calibrated at fixed points between the triple point
of equilibrium hydrogen at 13.8033 K and the freezing point of silver at
961.78 K, including the triple point of water at 0.060°C, the melting
point of Gallium at 29.7646 °C, and the freezing point of Indium at
156.5985 °C (Preston-Thomas <span id="id16">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id100" title="H. Preston-Thomas. The international temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90). Metrologia, 27(1):3–10, 1990.">99</a>]</span>). The triple point of water is the
temperature at which ice, water, and water vapor are in equilibrium. The

<p>The practical temperature scale was revised in 1887, 1927, 1948, 1968,
and 1990 as more accurate determinations of absolute temperature became
accepted. The most recent scale is the International Temperature Scale
of 1990 (<span class="small">ITS</span>-90). It differs slightly from the

<p>The annual range of surface temperature is highest at mid-latitudes,
especially on the western side of the ocean (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.3</span></a>: bottom). In the
west, cold air blows off the continents in winter and cools the ocean.
The cooling dominates the heat budget. In the tropics the temperature
range is mostly less than 2°.</p>
<p>The distribution of sea-surface salinity also tends to be zonal. The
saltiest waters are at mid-latitudes where evaporation is high. Less
salty waters are near the equator where rain freshens the surface, and
at high latitudes where melted sea ice freshens the surface (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-4"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.4</span></a>).

<h2><span class="section-number">6.4. </span>The Oceanic Mixed Layer and Thermocline<a class="headerlink" href="#the-oceanic-mixed-layer-and-thermocline" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Wind blowing on the ocean stirs the upper layers leading to a thin
<em>mixed layer</em> at the sea surface having constant temperature and
salinity from the surface down to a depth where the values differ from
those at the surface. The magnitude of the difference is arbitrary, but
typically the temperature at the bottom of the layer must be no more
than 0.02–0.1° colder than at the surface. Note that both temperature
and salinity must be constant in the mixed layer. We will see later that
mean velocity is not constant. The mixed layer is roughly 10–200 m
thick over most of the tropical and mid-latitude belts.</p>
<p>The depth and temperature of the mixed layer varies from day to day and
from season to season in response to two processes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Heat fluxes through the surface heat and cool the surface waters.
Changes in temperature change the density contrast between the mixed
layer and deeper waters. The greater the contrast, the more work is
needed to mix the layer downward and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Turbulence in the mixed layer mixes heat downward. The turbulence
depends on the wind speed and on the intensity of breaking waves.
Turbulence mixes water in the layer, and it mixes the water in the layer
with water in the thermocline.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The mid-latitude mixed layer is thinnest in late summer when winds are
weak, and sunlight warms the surface layer (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-7"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.7</span></a>). At times, the
heating is so strong, and the winds so weak, that the layer is only a
few meters thick. In fall, the first storms of the season mix the heat
down into the ocean thickening the mixed layer, but little heat is lost.
In winter, heat is lost, and the mixed layer continues to thicken,
becoming thickest in late winter. In spring, winds weaken, sunlight
increases, and a new mixed layer forms.</p>

<p>The shape of the thermocline varies slightly with the seasons (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-7"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.7</span></a>).
This is the <em>seasonal thermocline</em>. The <em>permanent thermocline</em>
extends from below the seasonal thermocline to depths of 1500–2000
meters (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-8"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.8</span></a>). At high latitudes, such as at the <span class="small">AAC</span>
station in the figure, there may be a cooler, fresher layer above the
permanent thermocline.</p>
<p>The mixed layer tends to be saltier than the thermocline between 10° and
40° latitude, where evaporation exceeds precipitation. At high latitudes
the mixed layer is fresher because rain and melting ice reduce salinity.
In some tropical regions, such as the warm pool in the western tropical
Pacific, rain also produces a thin fresher mixed layer.</p>

<p>During winter, cold water formed at the surface sinks to a depth
determined by its density relative to the density of the deeper water.
Currents then carry the water to other parts of the ocean. At all times,
the water parcel moves to stay below less dense water and above more
dense water. The distribution of currents within the ocean depends on
the distribution of pressure, which depends on the variations of density
inside the ocean as outlined in <a class="reference internal" href="chapter10.html#ch10-4"><span class="std std-ref">§10.4</span></a>. So, if we want to follow water
movement within the ocean, we need to know the distribution of density
within the ocean.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.1. </span>Density and sigma-t<a class="headerlink" href="#density-and-sigma-t" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The calculation of water movement requires measurements of density with
an accuracy of a few parts per million. This is not easy.</p>
<p><em>Absolute Density</em> of water can only be measured in special
laboratories, and only with difficulty. The best accuracy is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\,:\, 2.5 \times 10^5 = 4\)</span> parts per million.</p>
<p>To avoid the difficulty of working with absolute density, oceanographers
use density relative to density of pure water. Density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho (S, t, p)\)</span>
is now defined using Standard Mean Ocean Water of known isotopic
composition, assuming saturation of dissolved atmospheric gasses. Here
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S, t, p\)</span> refers to salinity, temperature, and pressure.</p>
<p>In practice, density is not measured, it is calculated from <em>in situ</em>
measurements of pressure, temperature, and conductivity using the
equation of state for sea water. This can be done with an accuracy of
two parts per million.</p>
<p>Density of water at the sea surface is typically 1027 kg/m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>. For
simplification, physical oceanographers often quote only the last 2
digits of the density, a quantity they call <em>density anomaly</em> or <em>Sigma
(S,t,p)</em>:</p>

<p>The Working Group on Symbols, Units and Nomenclature in Physical
Oceanography (<span class="smallcaps">sun</span>, 1985) recommends that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> be
replaced by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> was originally defined relative to

<p>As a water parcel moves within the ocean below the mixed layer, its salt
and heat content can change only by mixing with other water. Thus we can
use measurements of temperature and salinity to trace the path of the
water. This is best done if we remove the effect of compressibility.</p>
<p>As water sinks, pressure increases, the water is compressed, and the
compression does work on the water. This increases the internal energy
of the water. To understand how compression increases energy, consider a
cube containing a fixed mass of water. As the cube sinks, its sides move
inward as the cube is compressed. Recalling that work is force times
distance, the work is the distance the side moves times the force
exerted on the side by pressure. The change in internal energy may or
may not result in a change in temperature (McDougall and Feistel <span id="id25">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id105" title="T. J. McDougall and R. Feistel. What causes the adiabatic lapse rate? Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers, 50(12):1523–1535, 2003.">104</a>]</span>).
The internal energy of a fluid is the sum of molecular kinetic energy
(temperature) and molecular potential energy. In sea water, the later
term dominates, and the change of internal energy produces the
temperature change shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-9"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.9</span></a>. At a depth of 8 km, the increase

<p>To remove the influence of compressibility from measurements of
temperature, oceanographers (and meteorologists who have the same
problem in the atmosphere) use the concept of potential temperature.
<em>Potential temperature</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Theta\)</span> is defined as the temperature of a
parcel of water at the sea surface after it has been raised
adiabatically from some depth in the ocean. Raising the parcel
<em>adiabatically</em> means that it is raised in an insulated container so it
does not exchange heat with its surroundings. Of course, the parcel is
not actually brought to the surface. Potential temperature is calculated
from the temperature in the water at depth, the <em>in situ</em> temperature.</p>
</section>
<section id="potential-density">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.5.3. </span>Potential Density<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-density" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>If we are studying intermediate layers of the ocean, say at depths near
a kilometer, we cannot ignore compressibility. Because changes in
pressure primarily influence the temperature of the water, the influence
of pressure can be removed, to a first approximation, by using the
<em>potential density</em>.</p>
<p><em>Potential density</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho _{\Theta}\)</span> is the density a parcel of water
would have if it were raised adiabatically to the surface without change
in salinity. Written as sigma,</p>

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma _{\Theta}\)</span> is especially useful because it is a conserved thermodynamic property.</p>
<p>Potential density is not useful for comparing density of water at great
depths. If we bring water parcels to the surface and compare their
densities, the calculation of potential density ignores the effect of
pressure on the coefficients for thermal and salt expansion. As a
result, two water samples having the same density but different
temperature and salinity at a depth of four kilometers can have
noticeably different potential density. In some regions the use of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho(\Theta)\)</span> can lead to an apparent decrease of density with depth
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-10"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.10</span></a>) although we know that this is not possible because such a

<p>The use of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_r\)</span> leads to problems. If we wish to follow parcels of
water deep in the ocean, we might use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_3\)</span> in some areas, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_4\)</span> in others. But what happens when a parcel moves from a depth

discontinuity between the density of the parcel expressed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_3\)</span>
compared with density expressed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_4\)</span>. To avoid this difficulty,

precisely, it moves along a path of constant potential density

is the surface tangent to the neutral paths through a point in the

there is no buoyancy force acting on the parcel as it moves (if we

<h2><span class="section-number">6.6. </span>Measurement of Temperature<a class="headerlink" href="#measurement-of-temperature" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Temperature in the ocean is measured many ways. Thermistors and mercury
thermometers are commonly used on ships and buoys. These are calibrated
in the laboratory before being used, and after use if possible, using
mercury or platinum thermometers with accuracy traceable to national
standards laboratories. Infrared radiometers on satellites measure the
ocean’s surface temperature.</p>
<section id="mercury-thermometer">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.6.1. </span>Mercury Thermometer<a class="headerlink" href="#mercury-thermometer" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the most widely used, non-electronic thermometer. It was widely
used in buckets dropped over the side of a ship to measure the
temperature of surface waters, on Nansen bottles to measure sub-sea
temperatures, and in the laboratory to calibrate other thermometers.
Accuracy of the best thermometers is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->0.001°C with very careful calibration.</p>
<p>One very important mercury thermometer is the reversing thermometer
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-11"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.11</span></a>) carried on Nansen bottles, which are described in the next
section. It is a thermometer that has a constriction in the mercury
capillary that causes the thread of mercury to break at a precisely
determined point when the thermometer is turned upside down. The
thermometer is lowered deep into the ocean in the normal position, and
it is allowed to come to equilibrium with the water. Mercury expands
into the capillary, and the amount of mercury in the capillary is
proportional to temperature. The thermometer is then flipped upside
down, the thread of mercury breaks trapping the mercury in the
capillary, and the thermometer is brought back. The mercury in the
capillary of the reversed thermometer is read on deck along with the
temperature of a normal thermometer, which gives the temperature at
which the reversed thermometer is read. The two readings give the
temperature of the water at the depth where the thermometer was
reversed.</p>

<p>The reversing thermometer is carried inside a glass tube which protects
the thermometer from the ocean’s pressure because high pressure can
squeeze additional mercury into the capillary. If the thermometer is
unprotected, the apparent temperature read on deck is proportional to
temperature and pressure at the depth where the thermometer was flipped.
A pair of protected and unprotected thermometers gives temperature and
pressure of the water at the depth the thermometer was reversed.</p>
<p>Pairs of reversing thermometers carried on Nansen bottles were the
primary source of sub-sea measurements of temperature as a function of

<h3><span class="section-number">6.6.6. </span>Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-very-high-resolution-radiometer" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The most commonly used instrument to measure sea-surface temperature
from space is the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
<span class="small">AVHRR</span>. The instrument has been carried on all
polar-orbiting meteorological satellites operated by <span class="small">NOAA</span>
since Tiros-N was launched in 1978.</p>
<p>The instrument was originally designed to measure cloud temperatures and
hence cloud height. The instrument had, however, sufficient accuracy and
precision that it was soon used to measure regional and global
temperature patterns at the sea surface.</p>
<p>The instrument is a radiometer that converts infrared radiation into an
electrical voltage. It includes a mirror that scans from side to side
across the sub-satellite track and reflects radiance from the ground
into a telescope, a telescope that focuses the radiance on detectors,
detectors sensitive to different wavelengths that convert the radiance
at those wavelengths into electrical signals, and electronic circuitry
to digitize and store the radiance values. The instruments observes a
2700-km wide swath centered on the sub-satellite track. Each observation
along the scan is from a pixel that is roughly one kilometer in diameter
near the center of the scan and that increases in size with distance
from the sub-satellite track.</p>
<p>The radiometers measures infrared radiation emitted from the surface in
five wavelength bands: three infrared bands: 3.55–3.99 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m,
10.3–11.3 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m, and 11.5–12.5 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m; a near-infrared band at
0.725–1.10 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m; and a visible-light band at 0.55–0.90 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m. All
infrared bands include radiation emitted from the sea and from water
vapor in the air along the path from the satellite to the ground. The
3.7 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m band is least sensitive to water vapor and other errors, but
it works only at night because sunlight has radiance in this band. The
two longest wavelength bands at 10.8 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m and 12.0 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m are used to
observe sea-surface temperature and water vapor along the path in
daylight.</p>
<p>Data with 1-km resolution are transmitted directly to ground stations
that view the satellite as it passes the station. This is the Local Area
Coverage mode. Data are also averaged to produce observations from 4
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 4 km pixels. These data are stored by the satellite and later
transmitted to <span class="small">NOAA</span> receiving stations. This is the Global
Area Coverage mode.</p>
<p>The swath width is sufficiently wide that the satellite views the entire
earth twice per day, at approximately 09:00 AM and 9:00 PM local time.
Areas at high latitudes may be observed as often as eight or more times
per day.</p>
<p>The most important errors are due to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Unresolved or undetected clouds: Large, thick clouds are obvious in the
images of water temperature Thin clouds such as low stratus and high
cirrus produce much small errors that are difficult or almost impossible
to detect. Clouds smaller in diameter than 1 km, such as trade-wind
cumuli, are also difficult to detect. Special techniques have been
developed for detecting small clouds (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-12"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.12</span></a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Water vapor, which absorbs part of the energy radiated from the sea
surface: Water vapor reduces the apparent temperature of the sea
surface. The influence is different in the 10.8 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m and 12.0 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>m
channels, allowing the difference in the two signals to be used to
reduce the error.</p></li>
<li><p>Aerosols, which absorb infrared radiation. They radiate at temperatures
found high in the atmosphere. Stratospheric aerosols generated by
volcanic eruptions can lower the observed temperatures by up to a few
degrees Celsius. Dust particles carried over the Atlantic from Saharan
dust storms can also cause errors.</p></li>

The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), but oceanographers normally
report pressure in decibars (dbar), where:</p>

<p>Nansen Bottles (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-16"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.16</span></a>) were deployed from ships stopped at hydrographic stations.
<em>Hydrographic stations</em> are places where oceanographers measure water
properties from the surface to some depth, or to the bottom, using
instruments lowered from a ship. Usually 20 bottles were attached at
intervals of a few tens to hundreds of meters to a wire lowered over the
side of the ship. The distribution with depth was selected so that most
bottles are in the upper layers of the water column where the rate of
change of temperature in the vertical is greatest. A protected reversing
thermometer for measuring temperature was attached to each bottle along
with an unprotected reversing thermometer for measuring depth. The
bottle contains a tube with valves on each end to collect sea water at
depth. Salinity was determined by laboratory analysis of water sample
collected at depth.</p>

<p>After bottles had been attached to the wire and all had been lowered to
their selected depths, a lead weight was dropped down the wire. The
weight tripped a mechanism on each bottle, and the bottle flipped over,
reversing the thermometers, shutting the valves and trapping water in
the tube, and releasing another weight. When all bottles had been
tripped, the string of bottles was recovered. The deployment and

<h2><span class="section-number">6.10. </span>Light in the Ocean and Absorption of Light<a class="headerlink" href="#light-in-the-ocean-and-absorption-of-light" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Sunlight in the ocean is important for many reasons: It heats sea water,
warming the surface layers; it provides energy required by
phytoplankton; it is used for navigation by animals near the surface;
and reflected subsurface light is used for mapping chlorophyll
concentration from space.</p>
<p>Light in the ocean travels at a velocity equal to the velocity of light
in a vacuum divided by the index of refraction (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>), which is typically
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n = 1.33\)</span>. Hence the velocity in water is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.25 \times 10^8\)</span> m/s. Because light travels slower in water than in air,
some light is reflected at the sea surface. For light shining straight
down on the sea, the reflectivity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((n - 1)^2 /(n + 1)^2\)</span>. For
seawater, the reflectivity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.02 = 2\)</span>%. Hence most sunlight reaching
the sea surface is transmitted into the sea, little is reflected. This
means that sunlight incident on the ocean in the tropics is mostly
absorbed below the sea surface.</p>
<p>The rate at which sunlight is attenuated determines the depth which is
lighted and heated by the sun. Attenuation is due to absorption by
pigments and scattering by molecules and particles. Attenuation depends
on wavelength. Blue light is absorbed least, red light is absorbed most
strongly. Attenuation per unit distance is proportional to the radiance
or the irradiance of light:</p>

<p><em>Radiance</em> is the power per unit area per solid angle. It is useful for
describing the energy in a beam of light coming from a particular
direction. Sometimes we want to know how much light reaches some depth
in the ocean regardless of which direction it is going. In this case we
use <em>irradiance</em>, which is the power per unit area of surface.</p>
<p>If the absorption coefficient is constant, the light intensity decreases
exponentially with distance.</p>

<p><em>Clarity of Ocean Water</em> Sea water in the middle of the ocean is very
clear—clearer than distilled water. These waters are a very deep,
cobalt, blue—almost black. Thus the strong current which flows
northward offshore of Japan carrying very clear water from the central
Pacific into higher latitudes is known as the Black Current, or Kuroshio
in Japanese. The clearest ocean water is called Type I waters by Jerlov
(<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-18"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.18</span></a>). The water is so clear that 10% of the light transmitted
below the sea surface reaches a depth of 90 m.</p>

<p>In the subtropics and mid-latitudes closer to the coast, sea water
contains more phytoplankton than the very clear central-ocean waters.
Chlorophyll pigments in phytoplankton absorb light, and the plants
themselves scatter light. Together, the processes change the color of
the ocean as seen by observer looking downward into the sea. Very
productive waters, those with high concentrations of phytoplankton,
appear blue-green or green (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-19"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.19</span></a>). On clear days the color can be
observed from space. This allows ocean-color scanners, such as those on
SeaWiFS, to map the distribution of phytoplankton over large areas.</p>
<p>As the concentration of phytoplankton increases, the depth where
sunlight is absorbed in the ocean decreases. The more turbid tropical
and mid-latitude waters are classified as type II and III waters by
Jerlov (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-18"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.18</span></a>). Thus the depth where sunlight warms the water
depends on the productivity of the waters. This complicates the
calculation of solar heating of the mixed layer.</p>
<p>Coastal waters are much less clear than waters offshore. These are the
type 1–9 waters shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig6-18"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6.18</span></a>. They contain pigments from land,
sometimes called gelbstoffe, which just means yellow stuff, muddy water
from rivers, and mud stirred up by waves in shallow water. Very little
light penetrates more than a few meters into these waters.</p>

<li><p>Density is not measured, it is calculated from measurements of
temperature, salinity, and pressure using the equation of state of
sea water.</p></li>
<li><p>Accurate calculations of density require accurate definitions of
temperature and salinity and an accurate equation of state.</p></li>
<li><p>Salinity is difficult to define and to measure. To avoid the
difficulty, oceanographers use conductivity instead of salinity.
They measure conductivity and calculate density from temperature,
conductivity, and pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>A mixed layer of constant temperature and salinity is usually found
in the top 1–100 meters of the ocean. The depth is determined by
wind speed and the flux of heat through the sea surface.</p></li>
<li><p>To compare temperature and density of water masses at different
depths in the ocean, oceanographers use potential temperature and
potential density which remove most of the influence of pressure on
density.</p></li>
<li><p>Water parcels below the mixed layer move along neutral surfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Surface temperature of the ocean was usually measured at sea using
bucket or injection temperatures. Global maps of temperature combine
these observations with observations of infrared radiance from the
sea surface measured by an <span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> in space.</p></li>
<li><p>Temperature and conductivity are usually measured digitally as a
function of pressure using a <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span>. Before 1960–1970
the salinity and temperature were measured at roughly 20 depths
using Nansen bottles lowered on a line from a ship. The bottles
carried reversing thermometers which recorded temperature and depth
and they returned a water sample from that depth which was used to
determine salinity on board the ship.</p></li>
<li><p>Light is rapidly absorbed in the ocean. 95% of sunlight is absorbed
in the upper 100 m of the clearest sea water. Sunlight rarely
penetrates deeper than a few meters in turbid coastal waters.</p></li>
<li><p>Phytoplankton change the color of sea water, and the change in color
can be observed from space. Water color is used to measure
phytoplankton concentration from space.</p></li>
