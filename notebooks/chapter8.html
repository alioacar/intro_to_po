<p>Throughout most of the interior of the ocean and atmosphere friction is
relatively small, and we can safely assume that the flow is
frictionless. At the boundaries, friction, in the form of viscosity,
becomes important. This thin, viscous layer is called a <em>boundary
layer</em>. Within the layer, the velocity slows from values typical of the
interior to zero at a solid boundary. If the boundary is not solid, then
the boundary layer is a thin layer of rapidly changing velocity whereby
velocity on one side of the boundary changes to match the velocity on
the other side of the boundary. For example, there is a boundary layer
at the bottom of the atmosphere, the planetary boundary layer I
described in Chapter 3. In the planetary boundary layer, velocity goes
from many meters per second in the free atmosphere to tens of
centimeters per second at the sea surface. Below the sea surface,
another boundary layer, the Ekman layer described in Chapter 9, matches
the flow at the sea surface to the deeper flow.</p>
<p>In this chapter I consider the role of friction in fluid flows, and the
stability of the flows to small changes in velocity or density.</p>
<section id="the-influence-of-viscosity">
<h2><span class="section-number">8.1. </span>The Influence of Viscosity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-influence-of-viscosity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Viscosity is the tendency of a fluid to resist shear. In the last
chapter I wrote the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>–component of the momentum equation for a fluid
in the form (7:12a):
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}}+u\,\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}+v\,
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}+w\,\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}=-\,
\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}} + 2\,\Omega\,v\,\sin\vartheta + F_x\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
where \)</span>F_x$ was a frictional force per unit mass. Now we can consider
the form of this term if it is due to viscosity.</p>
<p>Molecules in a fluid close to a solid boundary sometime strike the
boundary and transfer momentum to it (figure 8.1). Molecules further
from the boundary collide with molecules that have struck the boundary,
further transferring the change in momentum into the interior of the
fluid. This transfer of momentum is <em>molecular viscosity</em>. Molecules,
however, travel only micrometers between collisions, and the process is
very inefficient for transferring momentum even a few centimeters.
Molecular viscosity is important only within a few millimeters of a
boundary.</p>
<p>Molecular viscosity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho \nu\)</span> is the ratio of the stress <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> tangential
to the boundary of a fluid and the velocity shear at the boundary. So
the stress has the form:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{xz} =  \rho \nu \,\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( for flow in the
\)</span>(x, z)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( plane within a few millimetres of the surface, where \)</span>\nu<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is
the kinematic molecular viscosity. Typically \)</span>\nu = 10^{-6}<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( m\)</span>^2$/s for
water at 20.</p>
<p>Generalizing (8.2) to three dimensions leads to a stress tensor giving
the nine components of stress at a point in the fluid, including
pressure, which is a normal stress, and shear stresses. A derivation of
the stress tensor is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find the
details in Lamb (1945: §328) or Kundu (1990: p. 93). For an
incompressible fluid, the frictional force per unit mass in (8.1) takes
the form:
$$F_x= \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left[ \nu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>\frac{\partial }{\partial y} \left[ \nu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right]</p></li>

<p>If molecular viscosity is important only over distances of a few
millimeters, and if it is not important for most oceanic flows, unless
of course you are a zooplankter trying to swim in the ocean, how then is
the influence of a boundary transferred into the interior of the flow?
The answer is: through turbulence.</p>
<p>Turbulence arises from the non-linear terms in the momentum equation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((u\,\partial{u}/\partial{x}\)</span>, <em>etc</em>.). The importance of these terms is
given by a non-dimensional number, the Reynolds Number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re\)</span>, which is
the ratio of the non-linear terms to the viscous terms:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Re = \frac{\text{Non-linear Terms}}{\text{Viscous
Terms}} =
\cfrac{\left( \displaystyle u\,\cfrac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}\right) }{\left( \displaystyle \nu\,\cfrac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x^2}}\right)
} \approx \cfrac{\D U\,\cfrac{U}{L\vphantom{y}}}{\D \nu\,\cfrac{U}{L^2}}
= \frac{UL}{\nu}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where, \)</span>U<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is a typical velocity of the flow and \)</span>L<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
is a typical length describing the flow. You are free to pick whatever
\)</span>U,L<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( might be typical of the flow. For example \)</span>L<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( can be either a
typical cross-stream distance, or an along-stream distance. Typical

\)</span>Re = 10^{11}<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. Because non-linear terms are important if Re \)</span>&gt;$ 10 –
1000, they are certainly important in the ocean. The ocean is turbulent.</p>
<p>The Reynolds number is named after Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912) who
conducted experiments in the late 19th century to understand turbulence.
In one famous experiment (Reynolds 1883), he injected dye into water
flowing at various speeds through a tube (figure 8.2). If the speed was
small, the flow was smooth. This is called <em>laminar flow</em>. At higher
speeds, the flow became irregular and turbulent. The transition occurred
at Re <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= VD/\nu \approx 2000\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> is the average speed in the pipe, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> is the diameter of the pipe.</p>
<p>As Reynolds number increases above some critical value, the flow becomes
more and more turbulent. Note that flow pattern is a function of
Reynold’s number. All flows with the same geometry and the same Reynolds
number have the same flow pattern. Thus flow around all circular
cylinders, whether 1 mm or 1 m in diameter, look the same as the flow at
the top of figure 8.3 if the Reynolds number is 20. Furthermore, the
boundary layer is confined to a very thin layer close to the cylinder,
in a layer too thin to show in the figure.</p>

From Richardson (1961). The appropriate flows are: A—a toothpick
moving at 1 mm/s; B—finger moving at 2 cm/s; F—hand out a car window
at 60 mph. All flow at the same Reynolds number has the same
streamlines. Flow past a 10 cm diameter cylinder at 1 cm/s looks the
same as 10 cm/s flow past a cylinder 1 cm in diameter because in both
cases Re <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= 1000\)</span>. <span id="fig:turbsketch" label="fig:turbsketch"></span></p>

<p>Prandtl, Karman and others who studied fluid mechanics in the early 20th
century, hypothesized that parcels of fluid in a turbulent flow played
the same role in transferring momentum within the flow that molecules
played in laminar flow. The work led to the idea of turbulent stresses.</p>
<p>To see how these stresses might arise, consider the momentum equation
for a flow with mean <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((U, V, W)\)</span> and turbulent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((u', v', w')\)</span>
components:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=U+u' \,;\quad v = V+v' \,;\quad w=W+w' \, ;\quad p=P+p'\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where the
mean value \)</span>U<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is calculated from a time or space average:

U = \langle u \rangle =\frac{1}{X}\int^X_0\,u(x)\,dx\)</span>$</p>
<p>The non-linear terms in the momentum equation can be written:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
\left&lt; (U+u')\frac{\partial{(U+u')}}{\partial{x}} \right&gt; &amp;= \left&lt;

{\partial{u'}}{\partial{x}}\right&gt; \notag \\
\left&lt; (U+u')\frac{\partial{(U+u')}}{\partial{x}} \right&gt; &amp;= \left&lt;

<p>Using (8.5) in (7.19) gives:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial{U }}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{V }}{\partial{y}}  +\frac{\partial{W }}{\partial{z}} +

from (8.8) splits the continuity equation into two equations:</p>

<p>Using (8.5) in (8.1) taking the mean value of the resulting equation,

<p>The Reynolds stresses such as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial{\langle u'w'\rangle}/\partial{z}\)</span> are called virtual stresses
(cf. Goldstein, 1965: §69 &amp; §81) because we assume that they play the

further, we need values or functional form for the Reynolds stress.
Several approaches are used.</p>
<section id="from-experiments">
<h3><span class="section-number">8.3.1. </span>From Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#from-experiments" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We can calculate Reynolds stresses from direct measurements of
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u', v', w'\)</span>) made in the laboratory or ocean. This is accurate, but
hard to generalize to other flows. So we seek more general approaches.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">8.3.2. </span>By Analogy with Molecular Viscosity<a class="headerlink" href="#by-analogy-with-molecular-viscosity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Let’s return to the example in figure 8.1, which shows flow above a
surface in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> plane. Prandtl, in a revolutionary paper
published in 1904, stated that turbulent viscous effects are only
important in a very thin layer close to the surface, the boundary layer.
Prandtl’s invention of the boundary layer allows us to describe very
accurately turbulent flow of wind above the sea surface, or flow at the
bottom boundary layer in the ocean, or flow in the mixed layer at the
sea surface. See the box <em>Turbulent Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate</em>.</p>
<p>To calculate flow in a boundary layer, we assume that flow is constant
in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> direction, that the statistical properties of the flow
vary only in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> direction, and that the mean flow is steady.
Therefore <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial /\partial t = \partial /\partial x = \partial /\partial y = 0\)</span>, and (8.10) can be written:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \Omega V \sin \varphi + \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \left[\nu \frac{\partial
U}{\partial z} - \langle u'w'\rangle \right] = 0\)</span>$</p>
<p>We now assume, in analogy with (8.2)
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(- \rho \langle u'w'\rangle = T_{xz} = \rho A_z \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
where \)</span>A_z<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is an *eddy viscosity* or *eddy diffusivity* which replaces
the molecular viscosity \)</span>\nu<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( in (8.2). With this assumption,
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial{T_{xz}}}{\partial{z}} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\left(A_z\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{z}}\right)
\approx A_z \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial z^2}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where I have assumed
that \)</span>A_z<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is either constant or that it varies more slowly in the \)</span>z<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
direction than \)</span>\partial U / \partial z<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. Later, I will assume that
\)</span>A_z \approx z$.</p>
<p>Because eddies can mix heat, salt, or other properties as well as
momentum, I will use the term eddy diffusivity. It is more general than
eddy viscosity, which is the mixing of momentum.</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> momentum equations for a homogeneous, steady-state,
turbulent boundary layer above or below a horizontal surface are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\rho fV + \frac{\partial {T_{xz}}}{\partial z} &amp; = 0 \\
\rho fU - \frac{\partial {T_{yz}}}{\partial z} &amp; = 0\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=2\omega \sin \varphi\)</span> is the Coriolis parameter, and I have
dropped the molecular viscosity term because it is much smaller than the
turbulent eddy viscosity. Note, (8.15b) follows from a similar
derivation from the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>-component of the momentum equation. We will need
(8.15) when we describe flow near the surface.</p>
<p>The assumption that an eddy viscosity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_z\)</span> can be used to relate the
Reynolds stress to the mean flow works well in turbulent boundary
layers. However <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_z\)</span> cannot be obtained from theory. It must be
calculated from data collected in wind tunnels or measured in the
surface boundary layer at sea. See Hinze (1975, §5–2 and§7–5) and
Goldstein (1965: §80) for more on the theory of turbulence flow near a
flat plate.</p>
<p>Prandtl’s theory based on assumption (8.13) works well only where
friction is much larger than the Coriolis force. This is true for air
flow within tens of meters of the sea surface and for water flow within
a few meters of the surface. The application of the technique to other
flows in the ocean is less clear. For example, the flow in the mixed
layer at depths below about ten meters is less well described by the
classical turbulent theory. Tennekes and Lumley (1990: 57) write:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mixing-length and eddy viscosity models should be used only to
generate analytical expressions for the Reynolds stress and
mean-velocity profile if those are desired for curve fitting purposes
in turbulent flows characterized by a single length scale and a single
velocity scale. The use of mixing-length theory in turbulent flows
whose scaling laws are not known beforehand should be avoided.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Problems with the eddy-viscosity approach:</p>
<p>Except in boundary layers a few meters thick, geophysical flows may be
influenced by several characteristic scales. For example, in the
atmospheric boundary layer above the sea, at least three scales may be
important: i) the height above the sea <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>, ii) the Monin-Obukhov scale
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> discussed in §4.3, and iii) the typical velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> divided by the
Coriolis parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U/f\)</span>.</p>
<p>The velocities <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u',\,w'\)</span> are a property of the <em>fluid</em>, while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_z\)</span> is a
property of the <em>flow</em>;</p>
<p>Eddy viscosity terms are not symmetric: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}

turbulence with statistical properties that are independent of

<p>The approach can be modified somewhat for flow in the ocean. In the
idealized case of high Reynolds flow, we can calculate the statistical
properties of a flow in thermodynamic equilibrium. Because the actual
flow in the ocean is far from equilibrium, we assume it will evolve
towards equilibrium. Holloway (1986) provides a good review of this
approach, showing how it can be used to derive the influence of
turbulence on mixing and heat transports. One interesting result of the
work is that zonal mixing ought to be larger than meridional mixing.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">8.4. </span>Mixing in the Ocean<a class="headerlink" href="#mixing-in-the-ocean" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Turbulence in the ocean leads to mixing. Because the ocean has stable
stratification, vertical displacement must work against the buoyancy
force. Vertical mixing requires more energy than horizontal mixing. As a
result, horizontal mixing along surfaces of constant density is much
larger than vertical mixing across surfaces of constant density. The
latter, however, usually called <em>diapycnal mixing</em>, is very important
because it changes the vertical structure of the ocean, and it controls
to a large extent the rate at which deep water eventually reaches the
surface in mid and low latitudes.</p>
<p>The equations describing mixing depend on many processes. See Garrett
(2006) for a good overview of the subject. Here I consider some simple
flows. A simple equation for vertical mixing by eddies of a tracer
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Theta\)</span> such as salt or temperature is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial t} + W\,\frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial z} =

<h3><span class="section-number">8.4.1. </span>Average Vertical Mixing<a class="headerlink" href="#average-vertical-mixing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Walter Munk (1966) used a very simple observation to calculate vertical
mixing in the ocean. He observed that the ocean has a thermocline almost
everywhere, and the deeper part of the thermocline does not change even
over decades (figure 8.4). This was a remarkable observation because we
expect downward mixing would continuously deepen the thermocline. But it
doesn’t. Therefore, a steady-state thermocline requires that the
downward mixing of heat by turbulence must be balanced by an upward
transport of heat by a mean vertical current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span>. This follows from
(8.21) for steady state with no sources or sinks of heat:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} = A_z \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
where \)</span>T$ is temperature as a function of depth in the thermocline.</p>
<p>The equation has the solution: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T \approx T_0 \exp (z/H)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>H=A_z/W<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the scale depth of the thermocline, and \)</span>T_0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the

<p>The large discrepancy between Munk’s calculation of the average eddy

<p>Polzin et al. (1997) measured the vertical structure of temperature in
the Brazil Basin in the south Atlantic. They found <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_z &gt; 10^{-3}\)</span>
m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>/s close to the bottom when the water flowed over the western flank
of the mid-Atlantic ridge at the eastern edge of the basin. Kunze and
Toole (1997) calculated enhanced eddy diffusivity as large as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A= 10^{-3}\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>/s above Fieberling Guyot in the Northwest Pacific and
smaller diffusivity along the flank of the seamount. And, Garbato et al
(2004) calculated even stronger mixing in the Scotia Sea where the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows between Antarctica and South
America.</p>
<p>The results of these and other experiments show that mixing occurs
mostly by breaking internal waves and by shear at oceanic boundaries:
along continental slopes, above seamounts and mid-ocean ridges, at
fronts, and in the mixed layer at the sea surface. To a large extent,
the mixing is driven by deep-ocean tidal currents, which become
turbulent when they flow past obstacles on the sea floor, including
seamounts and mid-ocean ridges (Jayne et al, 2004).</p>
<p>Because water is mixed along boundaries or in other regions
(Gnadadesikan, 1999), we must take care in interpreting temperature
profiles such as that in figure 8.4. For example, water at 1200 m in the
central north Atlantic could move horizontally to the Gulf Stream, where
it mixes with water from 1000 m. The mixed water may then move
horizontally back into the central north Atlantic at a depth of 1100 m.
Thus parcels of water at 1200 m and at 1100 m at some location may reach
their position along entirely different paths.</p>

<p>Eddies mix fluid in the horizontal, and large eddies mix more fluid than
small eddies. Eddies range in size from a few meters due to turbulence
in the thermocline up to several hundred kilometers for geostrophic
eddies discussed in Chapter 10.</p>
<p>In general, mixing depends on Reynolds number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> (Tennekes 1990: p. 11)

<p>Horizontal eddy diffusivity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^5 - 10^8\)</span> times larger than vertical
eddy diffusivity.</p>
<p>Water in the interior of the ocean moves along sloping surfaces of
constant density with little local mixing until it reaches a boundary
where it is mixed vertically. The mixed water then moves back into the
open ocean again along surfaces of constant density (Gregg 1987).</p>
<p>One particular case is particularly noteworthy. When water, mixing
downward through the base of the mixed layer, flows out into the
thermocline along surfaces of constant density, the mixing leads to the
<em>ventilated thermocline</em> model of oceanic density distributions.</p>
<p>Observations of mixing in the ocean imply that numerical models of the
oceanic circulation should use mixing schemes that have different eddy
diffusivity parallel and perpendicular to surfaces of constant density,
not parallel and perpendicular to level surfaces of constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> as I
used above. Horizontal mixing along surfaces of constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> leads to
mixing across layers of constant density because layers of constant
density are inclined to the horizontal by about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-3}\)</span> radians (see
§10.7 and figure 10.13).</p>
<p>Studies by Danabasoglu, McWilliams, and Gent (1994) show that numerical
models using isopycnal and diapycnal mixing leads to much more realistic
simulations of the oceanic circulation.</p>

<p>We saw in section 8.2 that fluid flow with a sufficiently large Reynolds
number is turbulent. This is one form of instability. Many other types
of instability occur in the in the ocean. Here, let’s consider three of
the more important ones: i) <em>static stability</em> associated with change of
density with depth, ii) <em>dynamic stability</em> associated with velocity
shear, and iii) <em>double-diffusion</em> associated with salinity and
temperature gradients in the ocean.</p>
<section id="static-stability-and-the-stability-frequency">
<h3><span class="section-number">8.5.1. </span>Static Stability and the Stability Frequency<a class="headerlink" href="#static-stability-and-the-stability-frequency" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider first static stability. If more dense water lies above less
dense water, the fluid is unstable. The more dense water will sink
beneath the less dense. Conversely, if less dense water lies above more
dense water, the interface between the two is stable. But how stable? We
might guess that the larger the density contrast across the interface,
the more stable the interface. This is an example of static stability.
Static stability is important in any <em>stratified</em> flow where density
increases with depth, and we need some criterion for determining the
importance of the stability.</p>
<p>Figure 8.5 Sketch for</p>
<p>calculating static stability and stability frequency.</p>
<p><span id="fig:stabilitysketch" label="fig:stabilitysketch"></span></p>
<p>Consider a parcel of water that is displaced vertically and
adiabatically in a stratified fluid (figure 8.5). The buoyancy force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>
acting on the displaced parcel is the difference between its weight
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V g \rho '\)</span> and the weight of the surrounding water <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V g \rho_2\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V\)</span> is the volume of the parcel: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F=V\,g\,(\rho_2-\rho{'})\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The

</ul>
<p>In the upper kilometer of the ocean stability is large, and the first
term in (8.34) is much larger than the second. The first term is
proportional to the rate of change of density of the water column. The
second term is proportional to the compressibility of sea water, which
is very small. Neglecting the second term, we can write the <em>stability
equation</em>: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boxed{E \approx -\frac{1}{\rho}\,\frac{d{\rho}}{d{z}} }\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(

<p>If velocity changes with depth in a stable, stratified flow, then the
flow may become unstable if the change in velocity with depth, the
<em>current shear</em>, is large enough. The simplest example is wind blowing
over the ocean. In this case, stability is very large across the sea
surface. We might say it is infinite because there is a step
discontinuity in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span>, and (8.36) is infinite. Yet, wind blowing on
the ocean creates waves, and if the wind is strong enough, the surface
becomes unstable and the waves break.</p>
<p>This is an example of <em>dynamic instability</em> in which a stable fluid is
made unstable by velocity shear. Another example of dynamic instability,
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, occurs when the density contrast in a
sheared flow is much less than at the sea surface, such as in the
thermocline or at the top of a stable, atmospheric boundary layer
(figure 8.7).</p>
<p>Figure 8.7 Billow clouds showing a Kelvin-Helmholtz</p>
<p>instability at the top of a stable atmospheric layer. Some billows can
become large enough that more dense air overlies less dense air, and
then the billows collapse into turbulence. Photography copyright Brooks
Martner, <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> Environmental Technology Laboratory.
<span id="fig:helmholtz" label="fig:helmholtz"></span></p>
<p>The relative importance of static stability and dynamic instability is
expressed by the <em>Richardson Number</em>:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boxed{R_i\equiv\frac{g\,E}{(\partial{U}/\partial{z})^2} }\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where the
numerator is the strength of the static stability, and the denominator
is the strength of the velocity shear. \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
R_i &amp;&gt;0.25 \quad \text{Stable} \notag \\
R_i &amp;&lt;0.25 \quad \text{Velocity Shear Enhances Turbulence} \notag\end{aligned}\)</span>$</p>
<p>Note that a small Richardson number is not the only criterion for
instability. The Reynolds number must be large and the Richardson number
must be less than 0.25 for turbulence. These criteria are met in some
oceanic flows. The turbulence mixes fluid in the vertical, leading to a
vertical eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity. Because the ocean tends to
be strongly stratified and currents tend to be weak, turbulent mixing is
intermittent and rare. Measurements of density as a function of depth
rarely show more dense fluid over less dense fluid as seen in the
breaking waves in figure 8.7 (Moum and Caldwell 1985).</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">8.5.3. </span>Double Diffusion and Salt Fingers<a class="headerlink" href="#double-diffusion-and-salt-fingers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In some regions of the ocean, less dense water overlies more dense
water, yet the water column is unstable even if there are no currents.
The instability occurs because the molecular diffusion of heat is about
100 times faster than the molecular diffusion of salt. The instability
was first discovered by Melvin Stern in 1960 who quickly realized its
importance in oceanography.</p>
<p>Figure 8.8 <strong>Left:</strong> Initial</p>
<p>distribution of density in the vertical. <strong>Right:</strong> After some time, the
diffusion of heat leads to a thin unstable layer between the two
initially stable layers. The thin unstable layer sinks into the lower
layer as salty fingers. The vertical scale in the figures is a few
centimeters. <span id="fig:saltfingers" label="fig:saltfingers"></span></p>
<p>Consider two thin layers a few meters thick separated by a sharp
interface (figure 8.8). If the upper layer is warm and salty, and if the
lower is colder and less salty than the upper layer, the interface
becomes unstable even if the upper layer is less dense than the lower.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens. Heat diffuses across the interface faster than
salt, leading to a thin, cold, salty layer between the two initial
layers. The cold salty layer is more dense than the cold, less-salty
layer below, and the water in the layer sinks. Because the layer is
thin, the fluid sinks in fingers 1–5 cm in diameter and 10s of
centimeters long, not much different in size and shape from our fingers.
This is <em>salt fingering</em>. Because two constituents diffuse across the
interface, the process is called <em>double diffusion</em>.</p>
<p>There are four variations on this theme. Two variables taken two at a
time leads to four possible combinations:</p>
<p><em>Warm salty over colder less salty</em>. This process is called <em>salt
fingering</em>. It occurs in the thermocline below the surface waters of
sub-tropical gyres and the western tropical north Atlantic, and in the
North-east Atlantic beneath the outflow from the Mediterranean Sea. Salt
fingering eventually leads to density increasing with depth in a series
of steps. Layers of constant-density are separated by thin layers with
large changes in density, and the profile of density as a function of
depth looks like stair steps. Schmitt et al (1987) observed 5–30 m
thick steps in the western, tropical north Atlantic that were coherent
over 200–400 km and that lasted for at least eight months. Kerr (2002)
reports a recent experiment by Raymond Schmitt, James Leswell, John
Toole, and Kurt Polzin showed salt fingering off Barbados mixed water 10
times faster than turbulence.</p>
<p><em>Colder less salty over warm salty</em>. This process is called <em>diffusive
convection</em>. It is much less common than salt fingering, and it us
mostly found at high latitudes. Diffusive convection also leads to a
stair step of density as a function of depth. Here’s what happens in
this case. Double diffusion leads to a thin, warm, less-salty layer at
the base of the upper, colder, less-salty layer. The thin layer of water
rises and mixes with water in the upper layer. A similar processes
occurs in the lower layer where a colder, salty layer forms at the
interface. As a result of the convection in the upper and lower layers,
the interface is sharpened. Any small gradients of density in either
layer are reduced. Neal et al (1969) observed 2–10 m thick layers in
the sea beneath the Arctic ice.</p>
<p><em>Cold salty over warmer less salty</em>. Always statically unstable. <em>Warmer
less salty over cold salty</em>. Always stable and double diffusion diffuses
the interface between the two layers.</p>
<p>Double diffusion mixes ocean water, and it cannot be ignored. Merryfield
et al (1999), using a numerical model of the ocean circulation that
included double diffusion, found that double-diffusive mixing changed
the regional distributions of temperature and salinity although it had
little influence on large-scale circulation of the ocean.</p>

<li><p>Friction in the ocean is important only over distances of a few
millimeters. For most flows, friction can be ignored.</p>
<p>The ocean is turbulent for all flows whose typical dimension exceeds
a few centimeters, yet the theory for turbulent flow in the ocean is
poorly understood.</p>
<p>The influence of turbulence is a function of the Reynolds number of
the flow. Flows with the same geometry and Reynolds number have the
same streamlines.</p>
<p>Oceanographers assume that turbulence influences flows over
distances greater than a few centimeters in the same way that
molecular viscosity influences flow over much smaller distances.</p>
<p>The influence of turbulence leads to Reynolds stress terms in the
momentum equation.</p>
<p>The influence of static stability in the ocean is expressed as a
frequency, the stability frequency. The larger the frequency, the

<p>The influence of shear stability is expressed through the Richardson
number. The greater the velocity shear, and the weaker the static

<p>Molecular diffusion of heat is much faster than the diffusion of
salt. This leads to a double-diffusion instability which modifies
