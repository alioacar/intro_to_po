<h1><span class="section-number">11. </span>Wind Driven Ocean Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#wind-driven-ocean-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>What drives the ocean currents? At first, we might answer, the winds.
But if we think more carefully about the question, we might not be so
sure. We might notice, for example, that strong currents, such as the
North Equatorial Countercurrents in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean go
upwind. Spanish navigators in the 16th century noticed strong northward
currents along the Florida coast that seemed to be unrelated to the
wind. How can this happen? And, why are strong currents found offshore
of east coasts but not offshore of west coasts?</p>
<p>Answers to the questions can be found in a series of three remarkable
papers published from 1947 to 1951. In the first, Harald Sverdrup (1947)
showed that the circulation in the upper kilometer or so of the ocean is
directly related to the curl of the wind stress if the Coriolis force
varies with latitude. Henry Stommel (1948) showed that the circulation
in oceanic gyres is asymmetric also because the Coriolis force varies
with latitude. Finally, Walter Munk (1950) added eddy viscosity and
calculated the circulation of the upper layers of the Pacific. Together
the three oceanographers laid the foundations for a modern theory of
ocean circulation.</p>
<section id="sverdrups-theory-of-the-oceanic-circulation">
<h2><span class="section-number">11.1. </span>Sverdrup’s Theory of the Oceanic Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#sverdrups-theory-of-the-oceanic-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>While Sverdrup was analyzing observations of equatorial currents, he
came upon (11.6) below relating the curl of the wind stress to mass
transport within the upper ocean. To derive the relationship, Sverdrup
assumed that the flow is stationary, that lateral friction and molecular
viscosity are small, that non-linear terms such as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\, \partial{u} / \partial{x}\)</span> are small, and that turbulence near the
sea surface can be described using a vertical eddy viscosity. He also
assumed that the wind-driven circulation vanishes at some depth of no
motion. With these assumptions, the horizontal components of the
momentum equation from 8.9 and 8.12 become:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}} =  f\,\rho\,v + \frac{\partial{T_{xz}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}} = -f\,\rho\,u + \frac{\partial{T_{yz}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<p>Sverdrup integrated these equations from the surface to a depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-D\)</span>
equal to or greater than the depth at which the horizontal pressure
gradient becomes zero. He defined:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
{2}
\frac{\partial{P}}{\partial{x}} &amp;= \int\limits_{-D}^{0} \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}\,dz,  &amp;\qquad
\frac{\partial{P}}{\partial{y}} &amp;= \int\limits_{-D}^{0} \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}}\,dz,  \\
M_x &amp;\equiv \int\limits_{-D}^{0} \rho\,u(z)\,dz,          &amp;\qquad M_y &amp;\equiv \int\limits_{-D}^{0} \rho\,v(z)\,dz,\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_x, M_y\)</span> are the mass transports in the wind-driven layer
extending down to an assumed depth of no motion.</p>
<p>The horizontal boundary condition at the sea surface is the wind stress.
At depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-D\)</span> the stress is zero because the currents go to zero:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
{2}
T_{xz}(0) &amp;= T_x &amp; \qquad T_{xz}(-D) &amp;= 0
\notag \\
T_{yz}(0) &amp;= T_y &amp; \qquad T_{yz}(-D) &amp;= 0\end{aligned}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>T_x<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and
\)</span>T_y$ are the components of the wind stress.</p>
<p>Using these definitions and boundary conditions, (11.1) become:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial{P}}{\partial{x}} &amp;= f\,M_y + T_x  \\
\frac{\partial{P}}{\partial{y}} &amp;= -f\,M_x + T_y\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In a similar way, Sverdrup integrated the continuity equation (7.19)
over the same vertical depth, assuming the vertical velocity at the
surface and at depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-D\)</span> are zero, to obtain:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial{M_x}}{\partial{x}} + \frac{\partial{M_y}}{\partial{y}} = 0\)</span>$</p>
<p>Differentiating (11.4a) with respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> and (11.4b) with respect to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, subtracting, and using (11.5) gives: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
\beta\,M_y &amp;= \frac{\partial{T_y}}{\partial{x}} - \frac{\partial{T_x}}{\partial{y}}
\notag \\

<h3><span class="section-number">11.1.1. </span>Comments on Sverdrup’s Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#comments-on-sverdrups-solutions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Sverdrup assumed i) The internal flow in the ocean is geostrophic; ii)
there is a uniform depth of no motion; and iii) Ekman’s transport is
correct. I examined Ekman’s theory in Chapter 9, and the geostrophic
balance in Chapter 10. We know little about the depth of no motion in
the tropical Pacific.</p>
<p>The solutions are limited to the east side of the ocean because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_x\)</span>
grows with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. The result comes from neglecting friction which would
eventually balance the wind-driven flow. Nevertheless, Sverdrup
solutions have been used for describing the global system of surface
currents. The solutions are applied throughout each basin all the way to
the western limit of the basin. There, conservation of mass is forced by
including north-south currents confined to a thin, horizontal boundary
layer (figure 11.3).</p>
<p>Only one boundary condition can be satisfied, no flow through the
eastern boundary. More complete descriptions of the flow require more
complete equations.</p>
<p>The solutions do not give the vertical distribution of the current.</p>
<p>Results were based on data from two cruises plus average wind data
assuming a steady state. Later calculations by Leetmaa, McCreary, and
Moore (1981) using more recent wind data produces solutions with
seasonal variability that agrees well with observations provided the
level of no motion is at 500 m. If another depth were chosen, the
results are not as good.</p>
<p>Wunsch (1996: §2.2.3) after carefully examining the evidence for a
Sverdrup balance in the ocean concluded we do not have sufficient
information to test the theory. He writes</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The purpose of this extended discussion has not been to disapprove the
validity of Sverdrup balance. Rather, it was to emphasize the gap
commonly existing in oceanography between a plausible and attractive
theoretical idea and the ability to demonstrate its quantitative
applicability to actual oceanic flow fields.—Wunsch (1996).</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Wunsch, however, notes</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sverdrup’s relationship is so central to theories of the ocean
circulation that almost all discussions assume it to be valid without
any comment at all and proceed to calculate its consequences for
higher-order dynamics…it is difficult to overestimate the importance
of Sverdrup balance.—Wunsch (1996).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But the gap is shrinking. Measurements of mean stress in the equatorial
Pacific (Yu and McPhaden, 1999) show that the flow there is in Sverdrup
balance.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">11.1.2. </span>Stream Lines, Path Lines, and the Stream Function<a class="headerlink" href="#stream-lines-path-lines-and-the-stream-function" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Before discussing more about the ocean’s wind-driven circulation, we
need to introduce the concept of stream lines and the stream function
(see Kundu, 1990: 51 &amp; 66).</p>
<p>At each instant in time, we can represent a flow field by a vector
velocity at each point in space. The instantaneous curves that are
everywhere tangent to the direction of the vectors are called the
<em>stream lines</em> of the flow. If the flow is unsteady, the pattern of
stream lines change with time.</p>
<p>The trajectory of a fluid particle, the path followed by a Lagrangian
drifter, is called the <em>path line</em> in fluid mechanics. The path line is
the same as the stream line for steady flow, and they are different for
an unsteady flow.</p>
<p>We can simplify the description of two-dimensional, incompressible flows
by using the <em>stream function</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi\)</span> defined by:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u \equiv \frac{\partial{\psi}}{\partial{y}}, \qquad v \equiv -
\frac{\partial{\psi}}{\partial{x}},\)</span>$</p>
<p>The stream function is often used because it is a scalar from which the
vector velocity field can be calculated. This leads to simpler equations
for some flows.</p>
<p>Stream functions are also useful for visualizing the flow. At each
instant, the flow is parallel to lines of constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi\)</span>. Thus if the
flow is steady, the lines of constant stream function are the paths
followed by water parcels.</p>
<p>The volume rate of flow between any two stream lines of a steady flow is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\psi\)</span>, and the volume rate of flow between two stream lines <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi_1\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi _2\)</span> is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi _1 - \psi _2\)</span>. To see this, consider an
arbitrary line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx = (dx, dy)\)</span> between two stream lines (figure 11.4).
The volume rate of flow between the stream lines is:</p>
<p>Figure 11.4 Volume transport</p>
<p>between stream lines in a<br />
two-dimensional, steady flow. After Kundu (1990: 68).</p>
<p><span id="fig:volxportsketch" label="fig:volxportsketch"></span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[v\,dx+(-u)\,dy=-\frac{\partial{\psi}}{\partial{x}}\,dx-\frac{\partial{\psi}}{\partial{y}}\,dy=-d\psi\]</div>
<p>and the volume rate of flow between the two stream lines is numerically
equal to the difference in their values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, lets apply the concepts to satellite-altimeter maps of the oceanic
topography. In §10.3 I wrote (10.10) $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
u_s &amp;= -\frac{g}{f}\,\frac{\partial{\zeta}}{\partial{y}} \notag \\
v_s &amp;= \frac{g}{f}\,\frac{\partial{\zeta}}{\partial{x}}\end{aligned}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
Comparing (11.13) with (11.11) it is clear that
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi = -\frac{g}{f}\,\zeta\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and the sea surface is a stream function
scaled by \)</span>g/f$. Turning to figure 10.5, the lines of constant height
are stream lines, and flow is along the lines. The surface geostrophic
transport is proportional to the difference in height, independent of
distance between the stream lines. The same statements apply to figure
10.9, except that the transport is relative to transport at the 1000
decibars surface, which is roughly one kilometer deep.</p>
<p>In addition to the stream function, oceanographers use the
mass-transport stream function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi\)</span> defined by:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_x \equiv \frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{y}}, \qquad M_y \equiv -

<h2><span class="section-number">11.2. </span>Stommel’s Theory of Western Boundary Currents<a class="headerlink" href="#stommels-theory-of-western-boundary-currents" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>At the same time Sverdrup was beginning to understand circulation in the
eastern Pacific, Stommel was beginning to understand why western
boundary currents occur in ocean basins. To study the circulation in the
north Atlantic, Stommel (1948) used essentially the same equations used
by Sverdrup (11.1, 11.2, and 11.3) but he added a bottom stress
proportional to velocity to (11.3):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
{2}
\left(A_z \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}\right)_0 &amp;= -T_x =-F\cos(\pi \,y/b)&amp; \qquad \left(A_z \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}\right)_D &amp;= -R\,u \\
\left(A_z \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{z}}\right)_0 &amp;= -T_y =0 &amp; \qquad \left(A_z \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{z}}\right)_D &amp;= -R\,v\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>

<p>Stommel calculated steady-state solutions for flow in a rectangular
basin <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\leq y\leq b\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\leq x\leq \lambda\)</span> of constant depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span>
filled with water of constant density. His first solution was for a
non-rotating earth. This solution had a symmetric flow pattern with no
western boundary current (figure 11.5, left). Next, Stommel assumed a
constant rotation, which again led to a symmetric solution with no
western boundary current. Finally, he assumed that the Coriolis force
varies with latitude. This led to a solution with western
intensification (figure 11.5, right). Stommel suggested that the
crowding of stream lines in the west indicated that the variation of
Coriolis force with latitude may explain why the Gulf Stream is found in
the ocean. We now know that the variation of Coriolis force with
latitude is required for the existence of the western boundary current,
and that other models for the flow which use different formulations for
friction, lead to western boundary currents with different structure.
Pedlosky (1987, Chapter 5) gives a very useful, succinct, and
mathematically clear description of the various theories for western
boundary currents.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will see that Stommel’s results can also be
explained in terms of vorticity—wind produces clockwise torque
(vorticity), which must be balanced by a counterclockwise torque
produced at the western boundary.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">11.3. </span>Munk’s Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#munks-solution" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Sverdrup’s and Stommel’s work suggested the dominant processes producing
a basin-wide, wind-driven circulation. Munk (1950) built upon this
foundation, adding information from Rossby (1936) on lateral eddy
viscosity, to obtain a solution for the circulation within an ocean
basin. Munk used Sverdrup’s idea of a vertically integrated mass
transport flowing over a motionless deeper layer. This simplified the
mathematical problem, and it is more realistic. The ocean currents are
concentrated in the upper kilometer of the ocean, they are not
barotropic and independent of depth. To include friction, Munk used
lateral eddy friction with constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_H = A_x = A_y\)</span>. Equations (11.1)
become:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\rho}\, \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}
&amp;=\quad f \,v+\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\left(A_z
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}\right) + A_H\,
\frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{x}^2} + A_H\, \frac{\partial^2{u}}{\partial{y}^2} \\
\frac{1}{\rho}\, \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}} &amp;=\:-f \,u+\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\left(A_z
\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{z}}\right) + A_H\, \frac{\partial^2{v}}{\partial{x}^2} + A_H\,
\frac{\partial^2{v}}{\partial{y}^2}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Munk integrated the equations from a depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-D\)</span> to the surface at
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z = z_0\)</span> which is similar to Sverdrup’s integration except that the
surface is not at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z = 0\)</span>. Munk assumed that currents at the depth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-D\)</span>
vanish, that (11.3) apply at the horizontal boundaries at the top and
bottom of the layer, and that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_H\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p>To simplify the equations, Munk used the mass-transport stream function
(11.15), and he proceeded along the lines of Sverdrup. He eliminated the
pressure term by taking the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> derivative of (11.17a) and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
derivative of (11.17b) to obtain the equation for mass transport:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underbrace{A_H \nabla^{4}

operator. Equation (11.18) is the same as (11.6) with the addition of

lateral boundary where the horizontal derivatives of the velocity field
are large, and it is small in the interior of the ocean basin. Thus in
the interior, the balance of forces is the same as that in Sverdrup’s
solution.</p>

<span id="fig:munkcurrents" label="fig:munkcurrents"></span></p>
<p>Equation (11.18) is a fourth-order partial differential equation, and
four boundary conditions are needed. Munk assumed the flow at a boundary
is parallel to a boundary and that there is no slip at the boundary:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Psi_{bdry} = 0, \qquad \left(\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{n}}\right)_{bdry} = 0\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
where \)</span>n<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is normal to the boundary. Munk then solved (11.18) with
(11.20) assuming the flow was in a rectangular basin extending from \)</span>x = 0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( to \)</span>x = r<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, and from \)</span>y = -s<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( to \)</span>y = +s<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(.

T&amp;=a\,\cos ny + b\,\sin ny \,+\, c  \notag \\
n&amp;=j\,\pi/s, \qquad j=1,\,2,\,\dots\end{aligned}\)</span>$</p>
<p>Munk’s solution (figure 11.6) shows the dominant features of the
gyre-scale circulation in an ocean basin. It has a circulation similar
to Sverdrup’s in the eastern parts of the ocean basin and a strong
western boundary current in the west. Using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_H = 5 \times 10^{3}\)</span>
m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span>/s gives a boundary current roughly 225 km wide with a shape
similar to the flow observed in the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio.</p>
<p>The transport in western boundary currents is independent of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_H\)</span>, and
it depends only on (11.6) integrated across the width of the ocean
basin. Hence, it depends on the width of the ocean, the curl of the wind
stress, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>. Using the best available estimates of the wind
stress, Munk calculated that the Gulf Stream should have a transport of
36 Sv and that the Kuroshio should have a transport of 39 Sv. The values
are about one half of the measured values of the flow available to Munk.
This is very good agreement considering the wind stress was not well
known.</p>
<p>Recent recalculations show good agreement except for the region offshore
of Cape Hatteras where there is a strong recirculation. Munk’s solution
was based on wind stress averaged aver 5squares. This underestimated the
curl of the stress. Leetmaa and Bunker (1978) used modern drag
coefficient and 2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 5 averages of stress to obtain 32 Sv transport
in the Gulf Stream, a value very close to that calculated by Munk.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">11.4. </span>Observed Surface Circulation in the Atlantic<a class="headerlink" href="#observed-surface-circulation-in-the-atlantic" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The theories by Sverdrup, Munk, and Stommel describe an idealized flow.
But the ocean is much more complicated. To see just how complicated the
flow is at the surface, let’s look at a whole ocean basin, the north
Atlantic. I have chosen this region because it is the best observed, and
because mid-latitude processes in the Atlantic are similar to
mid-latitude processes in the other ocean. Thus, for example, I use the
Gulf Stream as an example of a western boundary current.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the Gulf Stream to see how our understanding of ocean
surface currents has evolved. Of course, we can’t look at all aspects of
theflow. You can find out much more by reading Tomczak and Godfrey
(1994) book on<em>Regional Oceanography: An Introduction</em>.</p>
<section id="north-atlantic-circulation">
<h3><span class="section-number">11.4.1. </span>North Atlantic Circulation<a class="headerlink" href="#north-atlantic-circulation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The north Atlantic is the most thoroughly studied ocean basin. There is
an extensive body of theory to describe most aspects of the circulation,
including flow at the surface, in the thermocline, and at depth,
together with an extensive body of field observations. By looking at
figures showing the circulation, we can learn more about the
circulation, and by looking at the figures produced over the past few
decades we can trace an ever more complete understanding of the
circulation.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the traditional view of the time-averaged surface flow
in the north Atlantic based mostly on hydrographic observations of the
density field (figure 2.7). It is a contemporary view of the mean
circulation of the entire ocean based on a century of more of
observations. Because the figure includes all the ocean, perhaps it is
overly simplified. So, let’s look then at a similar view of the mean
circulation of just the north Atlantic (figure 11.7).</p>
<p>The figure shows a broad, basin-wide, mid latitude gyre as we expect
from Sverdrup’s theory described in §11.1. In the west, a western
boundary current, the Gulf Stream, completes the gyre. In the north a
subpolar gyre includes the Labrador current. An equatorial current
system and countercurrent are found at low latitudes with flow similar
to that in the Pacific. Note, however, the strong cross equatorial flow
in the west which flows along the northeast coast of Brazil toward the
Caribbean.</p>

<p>If we look closer at the flow in the far north Atlantic (figure 11.8) we
see that the flow is still more complex. This figure includes much more
detail of a region important for fisheries and commerce. Because it is
based on an extensive base of hydrographic observations, is this
reality? For example, if we were to drop a Lagrangian float into the
Atlantic would it follow the streamline shown in the figure?</p>
<p>To answer the question, let’s look at the tracks of a 110 buoys drifting
on the sea surface compiled by Phil Richardson (figure 11.9 top). The
tracks give a very different view of the currents in the north Atlantic.
It is hard to distinguish the flow from the jumble of lines, sometimes
called spaghetti tracks. Clearly, the flow is very turbulent, especially
in the Gulf Stream, a fast, western-boundary current. Furthermore, the
turbulent eddies seem to have a diameter of a few degrees. This is much
different than turbulence in the atmosphere. In the air, the large
eddies are called storms, and storms have diameters of 10–20. Thus
oceanic “storms” are much smaller than atmospheric storms.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can see the mean flow if we average the drifter tracks. What
happens when Richardson averages the tracks through
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}\)</span> boxes? The averages (figure 11.9 bottom)
begin to show some trends, but note that in some regions, such as east
of the Gulf Stream, adjacent boxes have very different means, some
having currents going in different directions. This indicates the flow
is so variable, that the average is not stable. Forty or more
observations do not yields a stable mean value. Overall, Richardson
finds that the kinetic energy of the eddies is 8 to 37 times larger than
the kinetic energy of the mean flow. Thus oceanic turbulence is very
different than laboratory turbulence. In the lab, the mean flow is
typically much faster than the eddies.</p>
<p>Further work by Richardson (1993) based on subsurface buoys freely
drifting at depths between 500 and 3,500 m, shows that the current

<p>If we look closely at figure 11.7 we see that the transport in the Gulf
Stream increases from 26 Sv in the Florida Strait (between Florida and
Cuba) to 55 Sv offshore of Cape Hatteras. Later measurements showed the
transport increases from 30 Sv in the Florida Strait to 150 Sv near 40N.</p>
<p>The observed increase, and the large transport off Hatteras, disagree
with transports calculated from Sverdrup’s theory. Theory predicts a
much smaller maximum transport of 30 Sv, and that the maximum ought to
be near 28N. Now we have a problem: What causes the high transports near
40N?</p>

<p>meanders lead to the formation of a spinning eddy, a ring.<br />
Notice that rings have a diameter of about 1. After Ring Group (1981).</p>
<p><span id="fig:ringformation" label="fig:ringformation"></span></p>
<p>Niiler (1987) summarizes the theory and observations. First, there is no
hydrographic evidence for a large influx of water from the Antilles
Current that flows north of the Bahamas and into the Gulf Stream. This
rules out the possibility that the Sverdrup flow is larger than the
calculated value, and that the flow bypasses the Gulf of Mexico. The
flow seems to come primarily from the Gulf Stream itself. The flow
between 60W and 55W is to the south. The water then flows south and
west, and rejoins the Stream between 65W and 75W. Thus, there are two
subtropical gyres: a small gyre directly south of the Stream centered on
65W, called the Gulf Stream recirculation region, and the broad,
wind-driven gyre near the surface seen in figure 11.7 that extends all
the way to Europe.</p>
<p>Figure 11.11 Sketch</p>
<p>of the position of the Gulf Stream, warm core, and cold core eddies
observed in infrared images of the sea surface collected by the infrared
radiometer on <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span>-5 in October and December 1978. After
Tolmazin (1985: 91).</p>
<p><span id="fig:ringsmap" label="fig:ringsmap"></span></p>
<p>The Gulf Stream recirculation carries two to three times the mass of the
broader gyre. Current meters deployed in the recirculation region show
that the flow extends to the bottom. This explains why the recirculation
is weak in the maps calculated from hydrographic data. Currents
calculated from the density distribution give only the baroclinic
component of the flow, and they miss the component that is independent
of depth, the barotropic component.</p>
<p>The Gulf Stream recirculation is driven by the potential energy of the
steeply sloping thermocline at the Gulf Stream. The depth of the 27.00
sigma-theta (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{\theta}\)</span>) surface drops from 250 meters near 41N
in figure 10.8 to 800 m near 38N south of the Stream. Eddies in the
Stream convert the potential energy to kinetic energy through baroclinic
instability. The instability leads to an interesting phenomena: negative
viscosity. The Gulf Stream accelerates not decelerates. It acts as
though it were under the influence of a negative viscosity. The same
process drives the jet stream in the atmosphere. The steeply sloping
density surface separating the polar air mass from mid-latitude air
masses at the atmosphere’s polar front also leads to baroclinic
instability. For more on this topic see Starr’s (1968) book on <em>Physics
of Negative Viscosity Phenomena</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this process in the Gulf Stream (figure 11.10). The strong
current shear in the Stream causes the flow to begin to meander. The
meander intensifies, and eventually the Stream throws off a ring. Those
on the south side drift southwest, and eventually merge with the stream
several months later (figure 11.11). The process occurs all along the
recirculation region, and satellite images show nearly a dozen or so
rings occur north and south of the stream (figure 11.11).</p>

<li><p>The theory for wind-driven, geostrophic currents was first outlined
in a series of papers by Sverdrup, Stommel, and Munk between 1947
and 1951.</p>
<p>They showed that realistic currents can be calculated only if the
Coriolis parameter varies with latitude.</p>
<p>Sverdrup showed that the curl of the wind stress drives a northward
mass transport, and that this can be used to calculate currents in
the ocean away from western boundary currents.</p>
<p>Stommel showed that western boundary currents are required for flow
to circulate around an ocean basin when the Coriolis parameter
varies with latitude.</p>
<p>Munk showed how to combine the two solutions to calculate the
wind-driven geostrophic circulation in an ocean basin. In all cases,
the current is driven by the curl of the wind stress.</p>
<p>The observed circulation in the ocean is very turbulent. Many years
of observations may need to be averaged together to obtain a stable
map of the mean flow.</p>
<p>The Gulf Stream is a region of baroclinic instability in which
turbulence accelerates the stream. This creates a Gulf Stream
recirculation. Transports in the recirculation region are much
larger than transports calculated from the Sverdrup-Munk theory.</p>
