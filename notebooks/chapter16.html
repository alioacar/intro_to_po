<h1><span class="section-number">16. </span>Ocean Waves<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean-waves" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Looking out to sea from the shore, we can see waves on the sea surface.
Looking carefully, we notice the waves are undulations of the sea
surface with a height of around a meter, where height is the vertical
distance between the bottom of a trough and the top of a nearby crest.
The wavelength, which we might take to be the distance between prominent
crests, is around 50-100 meters. Watching the waves for a few minutes,
we notice that wave height and wave length are not constant. The heights
vary randomly in time and space, and the statistical properties of the
waves, such as the mean height averaged for a few hundred waves, change
from day to day. These prominent offshore waves are generated by wind.
Sometimes the local wind generates the waves, other times distant storms
generate waves which ultimately reach the coast. For example, waves
breaking on the Southern California coast on a summer day may come from
vast storms offshore of Antarctica 10,000 km away.</p>
<p>If we watch closely for a long time, we notice that sea level changes
from hour to hour. Over a period of a day, sea level increases and
decreases relative to a point on the shore by about a meter. The slow
rise and fall of sea level is due to the tides, another type of wave on
the sea surface. Tides have wavelengths of thousands of kilometers, and
they are generated by the slow, very small changes in gravity due to the
motion of the sun and the moon relative to earth.</p>
<p>In this chapter you will learn how to describe ocean-surface waves
quantitatively. In the next chapter I will describe tides and waves
along coasts.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">16.1. </span>Linear Theory of Ocean Surface Waves<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-theory-of-ocean-surface-waves" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Surface waves are inherently nonlinear: The solution of the equations of
motion depends on the surface boundary conditions, but the surface
boundary conditions are the waves we wish to calculate. How can we
proceed?</p>
<p>We begin by assuming that the amplitude of waves on the water surface is
infinitely small so the surface is almost exactly a plane. To simplify
the mathematics, we can also assume that the flow is 2-dimensional with
waves traveling in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-direction. We also assume that the Coriolis
force and viscosity can be neglected. If we retain rotation, we get
Kelvin waves discussed in §14.2.</p>
<p>With these assumptions, the sea-surface elevation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> of a wave
traveling in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> direction is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta = a \sin (k \, x - \omega \, t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( with \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}

<p>The phase velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the speed at which a particular phase of the

<section id="group-velocity">
<h3><span class="section-number">16.1.3. </span>Group Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#group-velocity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The concept of group velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{g}\)</span> is fundamental for understanding
the propagation of linear and nonlinear waves. First, it is the velocity
at which a group of waves travels across the ocean. More importantly, it
is also the propagation velocity of wave energy. Whitham (1974, §1.3 and
§ 11.6) gives a clear derivation of the concept and the fundamental
equation (16.9).</p>
<p>The definition of group velocity in two dimensions is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{g} \equiv \frac {\partial \omega }{\partial k}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Using the

 c_{g} &amp;= \sqrt{g\,d} \, = c &amp; &amp;   \text{ Shallow-water group velocity}
 \end{aligned}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( For ocean-surface waves, the direction of propagation
is perpendicular to the wave crests in the positive \)</span>x$ direction. In
the more general case of other types of waves, such as Kelvin and Rossby
waves that we met in §14.2, the group velocity is not necessarily in the
direction perpendicular to wave crests.</p>
<p>Notice that a group of deep-water waves moves at half the phase speed of
the waves making up the group. How can this happen? If we could watch
closely a group of waves crossing the sea, we would see waves crests
appear at the back of the wave train, move through the train, and
disappear at the leading edge of the group. Each wave crest moves at
twice the speed of the group.</p>
<p>Do real ocean waves move in groups governed by the dispersion relation?
Yes. Walter Munk and colleagues (1963) in a remarkable series of
experiments in the 1960s showed that ocean waves propagating over great
distances are dispersive, and that the dispersion could be used to track
storms. They recorded waves for many days using an array of three
pressure gauges just offshore of San Clemente Island, 60 miles due west
of San Diego, California. Wave spectra were calculated for each day’s
data. (The concept of a spectra is discussed below.) From the spectra,
the amplitudes and frequencies of the low-frequency waves and the
propagation direction of the waves were calculated. Finally, they
plotted contours of wave energy on a frequency-time diagram (figure
16.1).</p>
<p>To understand the figure, consider a distant storm that produces waves
of many frequencies. The lowest-frequency waves (smallest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>)
travel the fastest (16.11), and they arrive before other,
higher-frequency waves. The further away the storm, the longer the delay
between arrivals of waves of different frequencies. The ridges of high
wave energy seen in the figure are produced by individual storms. The
slope of the ridge gives the distance to the storm in degrees <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span>
along a great circle; and the phase information from the array gives the
angle to the storm <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>. The two angles give the storm’s location
relative to San Clemente. Thus waves arriving from 15 to 18 September
produce a ridge indicating the storm was 115 away at an angle of
205 which is south of new Zealand near Antarctica.</p>
<p>The locations of the storms producing the waves recorded from June
through October 1959 were compared with the location of storms plotted
on weather maps and in most cases the two agreed well.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">16.1.5. </span>Significant Wave Height<a class="headerlink" href="#significant-wave-height" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>What do we mean by wave height? If we look at a wind-driven sea, we see
waves of various heights. Some are much larger than most, others are
much smaller (figure 16.2). A practical definition that is often used is
the height of the highest 1/3 of the waves, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1/3}\)</span>. The height is
computed as follows: measure wave height for a few minutes, pick out say
120 wave crests and record their heights. Pick the 40 largest waves and
calculate the average height of the 40 values. This is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1/3}\)</span> for the
wave record.</p>
<p>The concept of significant wave height was developed during the World
War II as part of a project to forecast ocean wave heights and periods.
Wiegel (1964: p. 198) reports that work at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography showed</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>…wave height estimated by observers corresponds to the average of
the highest 20 to 40 per cent of waves…Originally, the term
significant wave height was attached to the average of these
observations, the highest 30 per cent of the waves, but has evolved to
become the average of the highest one-third of the waves, (designated
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_S\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1/3}\)</span>)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>More recently, significant wave height is calculated from measured wave
displacement. If the sea contains a narrow range of wave frequencies,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1/3}\)</span> is related to the standard deviation of sea-surface
displacement (<span class="smallcaps">nas</span> , 1963: 22; Hoffman and Karst, 1975)
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_{1/3} = 4 \left&lt; \zeta ^{2}\right&gt;^{1/2}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>\left&lt; \zeta ^{2}\right&gt;^{1/2}$ is the standard deviation of surface
displacement. This relationship is much more useful, and it is now the
accepted way to calculate wave height from wave measurements.</p>

<p>Knowledge of non-linear waves came slowly until Hasselmann (1961, 1963a,
1963b, 1966), using the tools of high-energy particle physics, worked
out to 6th order the interactions of three or more waves on the sea
surface. He, Phillips (1960), and Longuet-Higgins and Phillips (1962)
showed that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> free waves on the sea surface can interact to produce
another free wave only if the frequencies and wave numbers of the

general requirements for any interacting waves. The fewest number of
waves that meet the conditions of (16.15) are three waves which interact
to produce a fourth. The interaction is weak; waves must interact for
hundreds of wave lengths and periods to produce a fourth wave with
amplitude comparable to the interacting waves. The Stokes wave does not
meet the criteria of (16.15) and the wave components are not free waves;
the higher harmonics are bound to the primary wave.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">16.2.1. </span>Wave Momentum<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-momentum" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The concept of wave momentum has caused considerable confusion
(McIntyre, 1981). In general, waves do not have momentum, a mass flux,
but they do have a momentum flux. This is true for waves on the sea
surface. Ursell (1950) showed that ocean swell on a rotating earth has
no mass transport. His proof seems to contradict the usual textbook
discussions of steep, non-linear waves such as Stokes waves. Water
particles in a Stokes wave move along paths that are nearly circular,
but the paths fail to close, and the particles move slowly in the
direction of wave propagation. This is a mass transport, and the
phenomena is called Stokes drift. But the forward transport near the
surface is balanced by an equal transport in the opposite direction at
depth, and there is no net mass flux.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">16.3. </span>Waves and the Concept of a Wave Spectrum<a class="headerlink" href="#waves-and-the-concept-of-a-wave-spectrum" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If we look out to sea, we notice that waves on the sea surface are not
sinusoids. The surface appears to be composed of random waves of various
lengths and periods. How can we describe this surface? The answer is,
Not very easily. We can however, with some simplifications, come close
to describing the surface. The simplifications lead to the concept of
the spectrum of ocean waves. The spectrum gives the distribution of wave
energy among different wave frequencies or wave lengths on the sea
surface.</p>
<p>The concept of a spectrum is based on work by Joseph Fourier
(1768–1830), who showed that almost any function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span> (or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (x)\)</span> if you like), can be represented over the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-T/2 \le t \le T/2\)</span> as the sum of an infinite series of sine and cosine
functions with harmonic wave frequencies:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n \cos 2\pi nft + b_n \sin
2\pi nft)\)</span>$ where</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
a_n &amp;= \frac{2}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \zeta (t) \cos 2\pi nft \, dt, \qquad
(n=0,1,2,\ldots) \\
b_n &amp;= \frac{2}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \zeta (t) \sin 2\pi nft \, dt, \qquad
(n=0,1,2,\ldots)\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f = 1/ T\)</span> is the fundamental frequency, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(nf\)</span> are harmonics of the
fundamental frequency. This form of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span> is called a <em>Fourier
series</em> (Bracewell, 1986: 204; Whittaker and Watson, 1963: §9.1). Notice
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_0\)</span> is the mean value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span> over the interval.</p>
<p>Equations (16.18 and 16.19) can be simplified using
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\exp (2\pi inft) = \cos (2\pi nft) + i \sin (2\pi nft)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>i = \sqrt{-1}<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. Equations (16.18 and 16.19) then become:

\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z_n = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \zeta (t) \exp ^{-i2\pi nft} \, dt, \qquad
(n=0,1,2,\ldots)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \)</span>Z_n<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is called the *Fourier transform* of
\)</span>\zeta (t)$.</p>
<p>The spectrum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(f)\)</span> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span> is: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(nf) = Z_n Z^*_n\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>Z^*<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
is the complex conjugate of \)</span>Z$. We will use these forms for the Fourier
series and spectra when we describing the computation of ocean wave
spectra.</p>
<p>We can expand the idea of a Fourier series to include series that
represent surfaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (x,y)\)</span> using similar techniques. Thus, any
surface can be represented as an infinite series of sine and cosine
functions oriented in all possible directions.</p>
<p>Now, let’s apply these ideas to the sea surface. Suppose for a moment
that the sea surface were frozen in time. Using the Fourier expansion,
the frozen surface can be represented as an infinite series of sine and
cosine functions of different wave numbers oriented in all possible
directions. If we unfreeze the surface and let it move, we can represent
the sea surface as an infinite series of sine and cosine functions of
different wave lengths moving in all directions. Because wave lengths
and wave frequencies are related through the dispersion relation, we can
also represent the sea surface as an infinite sum of sine and cosine
functions of different frequencies moving in all directions.</p>
<p>Note in our discussion of Fourier series that we assume the coefficients
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((a_n, b_n, Z_n)\)</span> are constant. For times of perhaps an hour, and
distances of perhaps tens of kilometers, the waves on the sea surface
are sufficiently fixed that the assumption is true. Furthermore,
non-linear interactions among waves are very weak. Therefore, we can
represent a local sea surface by a linear superposition of real, sine
waves having many different wave lengths or frequencies and different
phases traveling in many different directions. The Fourier series in not
just a convenient mathematical expression, it states that the sea
surface is really, truly composed of sine waves, each one propagating
according to the equations I wrote down in §16.1.</p>
<p>The concept of the sea surface being composed of independent waves can
be carried further. Suppose I throw a rock into a calm ocean, making a
big splash. According to Fourier, the splash can be represented as a
superposition of cosine waves all of nearly zero phase so the waves add
up to a big splash at the origin. Each individual Fourier wave begins to
travel away from the splash. The longest waves travel fastest, and
eventually, far from the splash, the sea consists of a dispersed train
of waves with the longest waves further from the splash and the shortest
waves closest. This is exactly what we see in figure 16.1. The storm
makes the splash, and the waves disperse as seen in the figure.</p>
<section id="sampling-the-sea-surface">
<h3><span class="section-number">16.3.1. </span>Sampling the Sea Surface<a class="headerlink" href="#sampling-the-sea-surface" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Calculating the Fourier series that represents the sea surface is
perhaps impossible. It requires that we measure the height of the sea
surface <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (x,y,t)\)</span> everywhere in an area perhaps ten kilometers on
a side for perhaps an hour. So, let’s simplify. Suppose we install a
wave staff somewhere in the ocean and record the height of the sea
surface as a function of time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span>. We would obtain a record like
that in figure 16.2. All waves on the sea surface will be measured, but
we will know nothing about the direction of the waves. This is a much
more practical measurement, and it will give the frequency spectrum of
the waves on the sea surface.</p>
<p>Working with a trace of wave height on say a piece of paper is
difficult, so let’s digitize the output of the wave staff to obtain
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
  \zeta _{j} \equiv \zeta (t_{j}), \qquad  t_{j} &amp;\equiv j \Delta  \\

<p>Notice that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta _{j}\)</span> is not the same as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span>. We have
absolutely no information about the height of the sea surface between
samples. Thus we have converted from an infinite set of numbers which
describes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta (t)\)</span> to a finite set of numbers which describe <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta _{j}\)</span>. By converting from a continuous function to a digitized function,
we have given up an infinite amount of information about the surface.</p>
<p>The sampling interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span> defines a <em>Nyquist critical frequency</em>
(Press et al, 1992: 494) $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Ny \equiv 1/( 2 \Delta )\)</span>$</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Nyquist critical frequency is important for two related, but
distinct, reasons. One is good news, the other is bad news. First the
good news. It is the remarkable fact known as the <em>sampling theorem</em>:
If a continuous function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta(t)\)</span>, sampled at an interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\)</span>,
happens to be <em>bandwidth limited</em> to frequencies smaller in magnitude
than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Ny\)</span>, i.e., if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(nf)=0\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|nf| \geq Ny\)</span>, then the
function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta(t)\)</span> is <em>completely determined</em> by its samples
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta _j\)</span>…This is a remarkable theorem for many reasons, among them
that it shows that the “information content” of a bandwidth limited
function is, in some sense, infinitely smaller than that of a general
continuous function…</p>
<p>Now the bad news. The bad news concerns the effect of sampling a
continuous function that is <em>not</em> bandwidth limited to less than the
Nyquist critical frequency. In that case, it turns out that all of the
power spectral density that lies outside the frequency range
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-Ny \le nf \le Ny\)</span> is spuriously moved into that range. This
phenomenon is called <em>aliasing</em>. Any frequency component outside of
the range <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((-Ny, Ny)\)</span> is <em>aliased</em> (falsely translated) into that
range by the very act of discrete sampling… There is little that you
can do to remove aliased power once you have discretely sampled a
signal. The way to overcome aliasing is to (i) know the natural
bandwidth limit of the signal — or else enforce a known limit by
analog filtering of the continuous signal, and then (ii) sample at a
rate sufficiently rapid to give at least two points per cycle of the
highest frequency present. —Press et al 1992, but with notation
changed to our notation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Figure 16.4 illustrates the aliasing problem. Notice how a high
frequency signal is aliased into a lower frequency if the higher
frequency is above the critical frequency. Fortunately, we can can
easily avoid the problem: (i) use instruments that do not respond to
very short, high frequency waves if we are interested in the bigger
waves; and (ii) chose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t\)</span> small enough that we lose little useful
information. In the example shown in figure 16.3, there are no waves in

<p>Ocean waves are produced by the wind. The faster the wind, the longer
the wind blows, and the bigger the area over which the wind blows, the
bigger the waves. In designing ships or offshore structures we wish to
know the biggest waves produced by a given wind speed. Suppose the wind
blows at 20 m/s for many days over a large area of the North Atlantic.
What will be the spectrum of ocean waves at the downwind side of the
area?</p>
<section id="pierson-moskowitz-spectrum">
<h3><span class="section-number">16.4.1. </span>Pierson-Moskowitz Spectrum<a class="headerlink" href="#pierson-moskowitz-spectrum" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Various idealized spectra are used to answer the question in
oceanography and ocean engineering. Perhaps the simplest is that
proposed by Pierson and Moskowitz (1964). They assumed that if the wind
blew steadily for a long time over a large area, the waves would come
into equilibrium with the wind. This is the concept of a <em>fully
developed sea</em>. Here, a “long time” is roughly ten-thousand wave
periods, and a “large area” is roughly five-thousand wave lengths on a
side.</p>
<p>Figure 16.7 Wave spectra of a fully developed</p>
<p>sea for different<br />
wind speeds according to Moskowitz (1964).</p>
<p><span id="fig:PMSpectra" label="fig:PMSpectra"></span></p>
<p>To obtain a spectrum of a fully developed sea, they used measurements of
waves made by accelerometers on British weather ships in the north
Atlantic. First, they selected wave data for times when the wind had
blown steadily for long times over large areas of the north Atlantic.
Then they calculated the wave spectra for various wind speeds (figure
16.7), and they found that the function
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(\omega) = \frac{\alpha g^{2}}{\omega ^{5}} \exp \left[ - \beta \left(
\frac{\omega _{0}}{\omega } \right) ^{4} \right]\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( was a good fit to the

\)</span>\omega <em>{0} = g/U</em>{19.5}<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and \)</span>U_{19.5}$ is the wind speed at a height
of 19.5 m above the sea surface, the height of the anemometers on the
weather ships used by Pierson and Moskowitz (1964).</p>
<p>For most airflow over the sea the atmospheric boundary layer has nearly
neutral stability, and $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_{19.5}\approx 1.026\, U_{10}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( assuming a
drag coefficient of \)</span>1.3 \times 10^{-3}$.</p>
<p>The frequency of the peak of the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum is
calculated by solving <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dS/d\omega = 0\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega _{p}\)</span>, to obtain
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega _{p} = 0.877 \,g/U_{19.5}.\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The speed of waves at the peak is

Hence waves with frequency \)</span>\omega _{p}$ travel 14% faster than the wind
at a height of 19.5 m or 17% faster than the wind at a height of 10 m.
This poses a difficult problem: How can the wind produce waves traveling
faster than the wind? I will return to the problem after I discuss the
<span class="smallcaps">jonswap</span> spectrum and the influence of nonlinear
interactions among wind-generated waves.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">16.4.3. </span>Generation of Waves by Wind<a class="headerlink" href="#generation-of-waves-by-wind" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We have seen in the last few paragraphs that waves are related to the
wind. We have, however, put off until now just how they are generated by
the wind. Suppose we begin with a mirror-smooth sea (Beaufort Number 0).
What happens if the wind suddenly begins to blow steadily at say 8 m/s?
Three different physical processes begin:</p>
<p>The turbulence in the wind produces random pressure fluctuations at the
sea surface, which produces small waves with wavelengths of a few
centimeters (Phillips, 1957).</p>
<p>Next, the wind acts on the small waves, causing them to become larger.
Wind blowing over the wave produces pressure differences along the wave
profile causing the wave to grow. The process is unstable because, as
the wave gets bigger, the pressure differences get bigger, and the wave
grows faster. The instability causes the wave to grow exponentially
(Miles, 1957).</p>
<p>Finally, the waves begin to interact among themselves to produce longer
waves (Hasselmann et al. 1973). The interaction transfers wave energy
from short waves generated by Miles’ mechanism to waves with frequencies
slightly lower than the frequency of waves at the peak of the spectrum.
Eventually, this leads to waves going faster than the wind, as noted by
Pierson and Moskowitz.</p>

<section id="wave-forecasting">
<h2><span class="section-number">16.5. </span>Wave Forecasting<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-forecasting" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Our understanding of ocean waves, their spectra, their generation by the
wind, and their interactions are now sufficiently well understood that
the wave spectrum can be forecast using winds calculated from numerical
weather models. If we observe some small ocean area, or some area just
offshore, we can see waves generated by the local wind, the <em>wind sea</em>,
plus waves that were generated in other areas at other times and that
have propagated into the area we are observing, the <em>swell</em>. Forecasts
of local wave conditions must include both sea and swell, hence wave
forecasting is not a local problem. We saw, for example, that waves off
California can be generated by storms more than 10,000 km away.</p>
<p>Various techniques have been used to forecast waves. The earliest
attempts were based on empirical relationships between wave height and
wave length and wind speed, duration, and fetch. The development of the
wave spectrum allowed evolution of individual wave components with
frequency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> travelling in direction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> of the directional wave
spectrum <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\psi (f, \theta )\)</span> using
$$\frac{\partial \psi_0 }{\partial t} + \mathbf{c_g \cdot \nabla }\psi_0 = S_{i}</p>
<ul class="simple">

\)</span>S_{d}$ is dissipation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third-generation wave-forecasting models now used by meteorological
agencies throughout the world are based on integrations of (16.39) using
many individual wave components (The <span class="smallcaps">swamp</span> Group 1985; The
<span class="smallcaps">wamdi</span> Group, 1988; Komen et al, 1996). The forecasts
follow individual components of the wave spectrum in space and time,
allowing each component to grow or decay depending on local winds, and
allowing wave components to interact according to Hasselmann’s theory.
Typically the sea is represented by 300 components: 25 wavelengths going
in 12 directions (30). To reduce computing time, the models use a nested
grid of points: the grid has a high density of points in storms and near
coasts and a low density in other regions. Typically, grid points in the
open ocean are 3 apart.</p>
<p>Some recent experimental models take the wave-forecasting process one
step further by assimilating altimeter and scatterometer observations of
wind speed and wave height into the model. Forecasts of waves using
assimilated satellite data are available from the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Noaa</span>’s Ocean Modeling Branch at the National Centers for
Environmental Predictions also produces regional and global forecasts of
waves. The Branch use a third-generation model based on the Cycle-4
<span class="smallcaps">wam</span> model. It accommodates ever-changing ice edge, and it
assimilates buoy and satellite altimeter wave data. The model calculates
directional frequency spectra in 12 directions and 25 frequencies at
3-hour intervals up to 72 hours in advance. The lowest frequency is
0.04177 Hz and higher frequencies are spaced logarithmically at
increments of 0.1 times the lowest frequency. Wave spectral data are
available on a 2.5<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 2.5 grid for deep-water points between 67.5S
and 77.5N. The model is driven using 10-meter winds calculated from the
lowest winds from the Centers weather model adjusted to a height of 10
meter by using a logarithmic profile (8.20). The Branch is testing an
improved forecast with 1<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 1.25 resolution (figure 16.10).</p>

Geosat from 1985 to 1988, <span class="smallcaps">ers–1 &amp;2</span> from 1991,
Topex/Poseidon from 1992, and Jason from 2001. Altimeter data have been
used to produce monthly mean maps of wave heights and the variability of
wave energy density in time and space. The next step, just begun, is to
use altimeter observation with wave forecasting programs, to increase
the accuracy of wave forecasts.</p>
<p>The altimeter technique works as follows. Radio pulse from a satellite
altimeter reflect first from the wave crests, later from the wave
troughs. The reflection stretches the altimeter pulse in time, and the
stretching is measured and used to calculate wave height (figure 16.11).

<p>Double integration of vertical acceleration gives displacement. The
double integration, however, amplifies low-frequency noise, leading to
the low frequency signals seen in figures 16.5 and 16.6. In addition,
the buoy’s heave is not sensitive to wavelengths less than the buoy’s
diameter, and buoys measure only waves having wavelengths greater than

<p>Gauges may be mounted on platforms or on the sea floor in shallow water.
Many different types of sensors are used to measure the height of the
wave or subsurface pressure which is related to wave height. Sound,
infrared beams, and radio waves can be used to determine the distance
from the sensor to the sea surface provided the sensor can be mounted on
a stable platform that does not interfere with the waves. Pressure
gauges described in §6.8 can be used to measure the depth from the sea
surface to the gauge. Arrays of bottom-mounted pressure gauges are
useful for determining wave directions. Thus arrays are widely used just
offshore of the surf zone to determine offshore wave directions.</p>
<p>Pressure gauge must be located within a quarter of a wavelength of the
surface because wave-induced pressure fluctuations decrease
exponentially with depth. Thus, both gauges and pressure sensors are
restricted to shallow water or to large platforms on the continental

<p>These radars map the radar reflectivity of the sea surface with spatial
resolution of 6–25 m. Maps of reflectivity often show wave-like
features related to the real waves on the sea surface. I say ‘wave-like’
because there is not an exact one-to-one relationship between wave
height and image density. Some waves are clearly mapped, others less so.
The maps, however, can be used to obtain additional information about
waves, especially the spatial distribution of wave directions in shallow
water (Vesecky and Stewart, 1982). Because the directional information
can be calculated directly from the radar data without the need to
calculate an image (Hasselmann, 1991), data from radars and altimeters

<p>The shape of the sea surface results from a linear superposition of
waves of all possible wavelengths or frequencies travelling in all
possible directions.</p>
<p>The spectrum gives the contributions by wavelength or frequency to
the variance of surface displacement.</p>
<p>Wave energy is proportional to variance of surface displacement.</p>
<p>Digital spectra are band limited, and they contain no information
about waves with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency.</p>
<p>Waves are generated by wind. Strong winds of long duration generate
the largest waves.</p>
<p>Various idealized forms of the wave spectrum generated by steady,
homogeneous winds have been proposed. Two important ones are the
Pierson-Moskowitz and <span class="smallcaps">jonswap</span> spectra.</p>
<p>Observations by mariners on ships and by satellite altimeters have
been used to make global maps of wave height. Wave gauges are used
on platforms in shallow water and on the continental shelf to
measure waves. Bottom-mounted pressure gauges are used to measure
waves just offshore of beaches. And synthetic-aperture radars are
used to obtain information about wave directions.</p>
