<p>If you have had a chance to travel around the United States, you may
have noticed that the climate of the east coast differs considerably
from that on the west coast. Why? Why is the climate of Charleston,
South Carolina so different from that of San Diego, although both are
near 32N, and both are on or near the ocean? Charleston has 125–150 cm
of rain a year, San Diego has 25–50 cm, Charleston has hot summers, San
Diego has cool summers. Or why is the climate of San Francisco so
different from that of Norfolk, Virginia?</p>
<p>If we look closely at the characteristics of the atmosphere along the
two coasts near 32N, we find more differences that may explain the
climate. For example, when the wind blows onshore toward San Diego, it
brings a cool, moist, marine, boundary layer a few hundred meters thick
capped by much warmer, dry air. On the east coast, when the wind blows
onshore, it brings a warm, moist, marine, boundary layer that is much
thicker. Convection, which produces rain, is much easier on the east
coast than on the west coast. Why then is the atmospheric boundary layer
over the water so different on the two coasts? The answer can be found
in part by studying the ocean’s response to local winds, the subject of
this chapter.</p>
<section id="inertial-motion">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.1. </span>Inertial Motion<a class="headerlink" href="#inertial-motion" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To begin our study of currents near the sea surface, let’s consider
first a very simple solution to the equations of motion, the response of
the ocean to an impulse that sets the water in motion. For example, the
impulse can be a strong wind blowing for a few hours. The water then
moves only under the influence of Coriolis force. No other force acts on
the water.</p>
<p>Such motion is said to be inertial. The mass of water continues to move
due to its inertia. If the water were in space, it would move in a
straight line according to Newton’s second law. But on a rotating earth,
the motion is much different.</p>
<p>From (7.12) the equations of motion for a parcel of water moving in the
ocean without friction are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{du}{dt}&amp;=-\frac{1}{\rho}\,\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}} + 2\Omega v\,\sin\varphi \\
\frac{dv}{dt}&amp;=-\frac{1}{\rho}\,\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}} - 2\Omega u\,\sin\varphi \\
\frac{dw}{dt}&amp;=-\frac{1}{\rho}\,\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{z}} + 2\Omega u\,\cos\varphi - g\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is pressure, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Omega = 2\,\pi\)</span>/(sidereal day)
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= 7.292 \times 10^{-5}\)</span> rad/s is the rotation of the earth in fixed
coordinates, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi\)</span> is latitude.</p>
<p>Let’s now look for simple solutions to these equations. To do this we
must simplify the momentum equations. First, if only the Coriolis force
acts on the water, there must be no horizontal pressure gradient:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}} = 0\)</span>$
Furthermore, we can assume that the flow is horizontal, and (9.1)
becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{du}{dt}&amp;=2\Omega \,v \sin\varphi =fv \\
\frac{dv}{dt}&amp;=-2\Omega \,u \sin\varphi = -fu\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boxed{f = 2\,\Omega\,\sin\varphi }\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the *Coriolis

<p>Inertial currents are the most common currents in the ocean (figure
9.1). Webster (1968) reviewed many published reports of inertial
currents and found that currents have been observed at all depths in the
ocean and at all latitudes. The motions are transient and decay in a few
days. Oscillations at different depths or at different nearby sites are
usually incoherent.</p>
<p>Inertial currents are caused by rapid changes of wind at the sea
surface, with rapid changes of strong winds producing the largest
oscillations. Although we have derived the equations for the oscillation
assuming frictionless flow, friction cannot be completely neglected.
With time, the oscillations decay into other surface currents. (See, for
example, Apel, 1987: §6.3 for more information.)</p>

<p>Steady winds blowing on (the sea surface produce a thin, horizontal
boundary layer, the <em>Ekman layer</em>. By thin, I mean a layer that is at
most a few-hundred meters thick, which is thin compared with the depth
of the water in the deep ocean. A similar boundary layer exists at the
bottom of the ocean, the <em>bottom Ekman layer</em>, and at the bottom of the
atmosphere just above the sea surface, the planetary boundary layer or
frictional layer described in §4.3. The Ekman layer is named after
Professor Walfrid Ekman, who worked out its dynamics for his doctoral
thesis.</p>
<p>Ekman’s work was the first of a remarkable series of studies conducted
during the first half of the twentieth century that led to an
understanding of how winds drive the ocean’s circulation (Table 9.1). In

<p>Fridtjof Nansen noticed that wind tended to blow ice at an angle of
20–40 to the right of the wind in the Arctic, by which he meant that
the track of the iceberg was to the right of the wind looking downwind
(See figure 9.2). He later worked out the balance of forces that must
exist when wind tried to push icebergs downwind on a rotating earth.</p>
<p>Nansen argued that three forces must be important:</p>
<p>Wind Stress, <strong>W</strong>; Friction <strong>F</strong> (otherwise the iceberg would move as
fast as the wind); Coriolis Force, <strong>C</strong>.</p>
<p>Nansen argued further that the forces must have the following
attributes:</p>
<p>Drag must be opposite the direction of the ice’s velocity; Coriolis
force must be perpendicular to the velocity; The forces must balance for
steady flow.</p>
<p><strong>W</strong> + <strong>F</strong> + <strong>C</strong> = 0</p>

<p>Nansen asked Vilhelm Bjerknes to let one of Bjerknes’ students make a
theoretical study of the influence of earth’s rotation on wind-driven
currents. Walfrid Ekman was chosen, and he presented the results in his
thesis at Uppsala (Kullenberg, 1954). Ekman later expanded the study to
include the influence of continents and differences of density of water
(Ekman, 1905). The following follows Ekman’s line of reasoning in that
paper.</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 The balance of forces</p>
<p>acting on an iceberg in a wind on a rotating earth.</p>
<p><span id="fig:forcesketch" label="fig:forcesketch"></span></p>
<p>Ekman assumed a steady, homogeneous, horizontal flow with friction on a
rotating earth. Thus horizontal and temporal derivatives are zero:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}}=0\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
For flow on a rotating earth, this leaves a balance between frictional
and Coriolis forces (8.15). Ekman further assumed a constant vertical
eddy viscosity of the form (8:13):
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{xz} \,=\,\rho\, A_z \,\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{z}}\: , \qquad T_{yz}\,=\,\rho\, A_z \,\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{z}}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(

<p>Using (9.7) in (8.15), the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> momentum equations are:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is the Coriolis parameter.</p>

<p>The current has a speed of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_0\)</span> to the northeast. In general, the
surface current is 45 to the right of the wind when looking downwind in
the northern hemisphere. The current is 45 to the left of the wind in

exponentially with depth (figure 9.3):

<p>Does the flow close to the sea surface agree with Ekman’s theory?
Measurements of currents made during several, very careful experiments
indicate that Ekman’s theory is remarkably good. The theory accurately
describes the flow averaged over many days.</p>
<p>Weller and Plueddmann (1996) measured currents from 2 m to 132 m using
14 vector-measuring current meters deployed from the Floating Instrument
Platform <span class="smallcaps">flip</span> in February and March 1990 500 km west of
point Conception, California. This was the last of a remarkable series
of experiments coordinated by Weller using instruments on
<span class="smallcaps">flip</span>.</p>
<p>Davis, DeSzoeke, and Niiler (1981) measured currents from 2 m to 175 m
using 19 vector-measuring current meters deployed from a mooring for 19
days in August and September 1977 at 50N, 145W in the northeast Pacific.</p>
<p>Ralph and Niiler (2000) tracked 1503 drifters drogued to 15 m depth in
the Pacific from March 1987 to December 1994. Wind velocity was obtained
every 6 hours from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts <span class="smallcaps">ecmwf</span>.</p>
<p>The results of the experiments indicate that:</p>
<p>Inertial currents are the largest component of the flow.</p>
<p>The flow is nearly independent of depth within the mixed layer for
periods near the inertial period. Thus the mixed layer moves like a slab
at the inertial period. Current shear is concentrated at the top of the
thermocline.</p>
<p>The flow averaged over many inertial periods is almost exactly that
calculated from Ekman’s theory. The shear of the Ekman currents extends
through the averaged mixed layer and into the thermocline. Ralph and
Niiler found (using SI units, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U\)</span> in m/s): $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}

<p>The angle between the wind and the flow at the surface depends on
latitude, and it is near 45 at mid latitudes (figure 9.6).</p>
<p>The transport is 90 to the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere.

<p>Ralph and Niiler (2000) point out that Ekman’s choice of an equation for
surface currents (9.14), which leads to (9.16), is consistent with
theories that include the influence of stability in the upper ocean.
Currents with periods near the inertial period produce shear in the
thermocline. The shear mixes the surface layers when the Richardson
number falls below the critical value (Pollard et al. 1973). This idea,
when included in mixed-layer theories, leads to a surface current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_0\)</span>
that is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{N/f}\)</span> $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_0 \sim U_{10}  \sqrt{N/f}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(

<p>We calculate the Ekman mass transports by integrating (8.15) in (9.24):
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\begin{aligned}
f\int_{-d}^0\rho\,V_E\,dz =f\,M_{Ey} &amp;=-\int_{-d}^0 \,d T_{xz}   \notag \\
f\,M_{Ey} &amp;=-T_{xz}\big|_{z=0} + T_{xz}\big|_{z=-d}\end{aligned}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( A few
hundred meters below the surface the Ekman velocities approach zero, and
the last term of (9.25) is zero. Thus mass transport is due only to wind
stress at the sea surface \)</span>(z = 0)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. In a similar way, we can calculate
the transport in the \)</span>x$ direction to obtain the two components of the
<em>Ekman transport</em>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
f\,M_{Ey} &amp;= -T_{xz}(0) \\
f\,M_{Ex} &amp;= \;\;\; T_{yz}(0)\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{xz}(0), T_{yz}(0)\)</span> are the two components of the stress at the
sea surface.</p>
<p>Notice that the transport is perpendicular to the wind stress, and to
the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere. If the wind is to the
north in the positive <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> direction (a south wind), then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{xz}(0) = 0\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{Ey} = 0\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M_{Ex} = T_{yz}(0)/f\)</span>. In the northern
hemisphere, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is positive, and the mass transport is in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
direction, to the east.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that the drag of the wind on the water leads to a
current at right angles to the drag. The result follows from the
assumption that friction is confined to a thin surface boundary layer,
that it is zero in the interior of the ocean, and that the current is in
equilibrium with the wind so that it is no longer accelerating.</p>
<p><em>Volume transport</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> is the mass transport divided by the density of
water and multiplied by the width perpendicular to the transport.
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_x=\frac{Y M_x}{\rho}, \qquad Q_y=\frac{X M_y}{\rho}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>Y<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is
the north-south distance across which the eastward transport \)</span>Q_x<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is
calculated, and \)</span>X<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( in the east-west distance across which the northward
transport \)</span>Q_y$ is calculated. Volume transport has dimensions of cubic
meters per second. A convenient unit for volume transport in the ocean
is a million cubic meters per second. This unit is called a <em>Sverdrup</em>,
and it is abbreviated Sv.</p>
<p>Recent observations of Ekman transport in the ocean agree with the
theoretical values (9.26). Chereskin and Roemmich (1991) measured the
Ekman volume transport across 11N in the Atlantic using an acoustic
Doppler current profiler described in Chapter 10. They calculated a
transport of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_y = 12.0 \pm 5.5\)</span> Sv (northward) from direct
measurements of current, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_y = 8.8 \pm 1.9\)</span> Sv from measured winds
using (9.26) and (9.27), and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_y = 13.5 \pm 0.3\)</span> Sv from mean winds
averaged over many years at 11N.</p>
<section id="use-of-transports">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.3.1. </span>Use of Transports<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-transports" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Mass transports are widely used for two important reasons. First, the
calculation is much more robust than calculations of velocities in the
Ekman layer. By robust, I mean that the calculation is based on fewer
assumptions, and that the results are more likely to be correct. Thus
the calculated mass transport does not depend on knowing the
distribution of velocity in the Ekman layer or the eddy viscosity.</p>
<p>Second, the variability of transport in space has important
consequences. Let’s look at a few applications.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="application-of-ekman-theory">
<h2><span class="section-number">9.4. </span>Application of Ekman Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#application-of-ekman-theory" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Because steady winds blowing on the sea surface produce an Ekman layer
that transports water at right angles to the wind direction, any spatial
variability of the wind, or winds blowing along some coasts, can lead to
upwelling. And upwelling is important:</p>
<p>Upwelling enhances biological productivity, which feeds fisheries.</p>
<p>Cold upwelled water alters local weather. Weather onshore of regions of
upwelling tend to have fog, low stratus clouds, a stable stratified
atmosphere, little convection, and little rain.</p>
<p>Spatial variability of transports in the open ocean leads to upwelling
and downwelling, which leads to redistribution of mass in the ocean,
which leads to wind-driven geostrophic currents via Ekman pumping.</p>
<section id="coastal-upwelling">
<h3><span class="section-number">9.4.1. </span>Coastal Upwelling<a class="headerlink" href="#coastal-upwelling" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>To see how winds lead to upwelling, consider north winds blowing
parallel to the California Coast (figure 9.8 left). The winds produce a
mass transport away from the shore everywhere along the shore. The water
pushed offshore can be replaced only by water from below the Ekman
layer. This is <em>upwelling</em> (figure 9.8 right). Because the upwelled
water is cold, the upwelling leads to a region of cold water at the
surface along the coast. Figure 10.16 shows the distribution of cold
water off the coast of California.</p>
<p>Figure 9.8 Sketch of</p>
<p>Ekman transport along a coast leading to upwelling of cold water along
the coast. <strong>Left:</strong> Plan view. North winds along a west coast in the
northern hemisphere cause Ekman transports away from the shore.
<strong>Right:</strong> Cross section. The water transported offshore must be
replaced by water upwelling from below the mixed layer.
<span id="fig:upwelling" label="fig:upwelling"></span></p>
<p>Upwelled water is colder than water normally found on the surface, and
it is richer in nutrients. The nutrients fertilize phytoplankton in the
mixed layer, which are eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by small
fish, which are eaten by larger fish and so on to infinity. As a result,
upwelling regions are productive waters supporting the world’s major
fisheries. The important regions are offshore of Peru, California,
Somalia, Morocco, and Namibia.</p>
<p>Now I can answer the question I asked at the beginning of the chapter:
Why is the climate of San Francisco so different from that of Norfolk,
Virginia? Figures 4.2 or 9.8 show that wind along the California and
Oregon coasts has a strong southward component. The wind causes
upwelling along the coast, which leads to cold water close to shore. The
shoreward component of the wind brings warmer air from far offshore over
the colder water, which cools the incoming air close to the sea, leading
to a thin, cool atmospheric boundary layer. As the air cools, fog forms
along the coast. Finally, the cool layer of air is blown over San
Francisco, cooling the city. The warmer air above the boundary layer,
due to downward velocity of the Hadley circulation in the atmosphere
(see figure 4.3), inhibits vertical convection, and rain is rare. Rain
forms only when winter storms coming ashore bring strong convection
higher up in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In addition to upwelling, other processes influence weather in
California and Virginia.</p>
<p>The oceanic mixed layer tends to be thin on the eastern side of ocean,
and upwelling can easily bring up cold water.</p>
<p>Currents along the eastern side of the ocean at mid-latitudes tend to
bring colder water from higher latitudes.</p>
<p>All these processes are reversed offshore of east coasts, leading to
warm water close to shore, thick atmospheric boundary layers, and
frequent convective rain. Thus Norfolk is much different that San
Francisco due to upwelling and the direction of the coastal currents.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">9.4.2. </span>Ekman Pumping<a class="headerlink" href="#ekman-pumping" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The horizontal variability of the wind blowing on the sea surface leads
to horizontal variability of the Ekman transports. Because mass must be
conserved, the spatial variability of the transports must lead to
vertical velocities at the top of the Ekman layer. To calculate this
velocity, we first integrate the continuity equation (7.19) in the
vertical:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\rho\int_{-d}^0 \left( \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}+\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}+\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{z}} \right) dz &amp;=0
\notag
\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}\int_{-d}^0 \rho\,u\,dz +\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}}\int_{-d}^0\rho\,v\,dz
&amp;=- \rho \int_{-d}^0 \frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{z}}\, dz
\notag \\
\frac{\partial{M_{Ex}}}{\partial{x}}+\frac{\partial{M_{Ey}}}{\partial{y}} &amp;=-\rho \left[ w(0)-w(-d)\right]
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>By definition, the Ekman velocities approach zero at the base of the
Ekman layer, and the vertical velocity at the base of the layer
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_E(-d)\)</span> due to divergence of the Ekman flow must be zero. Therefore:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\partial M_{Ex}}{\partial{x}}+\frac{\partial M_{Ey}}{\partial{y}} = -
\rho\,w_E(0)$$ $$\boxed{\nabla_H \cdot \mathbf{M}_E = -\rho\,w_E(0)}\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{M}_E\)</span> is the vector mass transport due to Ekman flow in
the upper boundary layer of the ocean, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nabla_H\)</span> is the horizontal
divergence operator. (9.28) states that the horizontal divergence of the
Ekman transports leads to a vertical velocity in the upper boundary
layer of the ocean, a process called <em>Ekman Pumping</em>.</p>
<p>If we use the Ekman mass transports (9.26) in (9.28) we can relate Ekman
pumping to the wind stress.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
w_E(0)
&amp;=-\frac{1}{\rho}\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial{x}} \left( \frac{T_{yz}(0)}{f}
\right) -\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}} \left( \frac{T_{xz}(0)}{f} \right) \right]
\\ w_E(0) &amp;=-\text{curl}_z  \left( \frac{\mathbf{T}}{\rho\,f} \right)\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> is the vector wind stress and the subscript <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>
indicates the vertical component of the curl.</p>
<p>The vertical velocity at the sea surface <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w(0)\)</span> must be zero because the
surface cannot rise into the air, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_E(0)\)</span> must be balanced by
another vertical velocity. We will see in Chapter 12 that it is balanced
by a geostrophic velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(w_G(0)\)</span> at the top of the interior flow in
the ocean.</p>
<p>Note that the derivation above follows Pedlosky (1996: 13), and it
differs from the traditional approach that leads to a vertical velocity
at the base of the Ekman layer. Pedlosky points out that if the Ekman
layer is very thin compared with the depth of the ocean, it makes no
difference whether the velocity is calculated at the top or bottom of
the Ekman layer, but this is usually not true for the ocean. Hence, we
must compute vertical velocity at the top of the layer.</p>

<p>Measurements of surface currents show that winds generate more than
Ekman and inertial currents at the sea surface. They also generate a
Langmuir circulation (Langmuir, 1938), a current that spiral around an
axis parallel to the wind direction. Weller et al. (1985) observed such
a flow during an experiment to measure the wind-driven circulation in
the upper 50 meters of the sea. They found that during a period when the
wind speed was 14 m/s, surface currents were organized into Langmuir
cells spaced 20 m apart, the cells were aligned at an angle of 15 to the
right of the wind, and vertical velocity at 23 m depth was concentrated
in narrow jets under the areas of surface convergence (figure 9.9).
Maximum vertical velocity was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-0.18\)</span> m/s. The seasonal thermocline was
at 50 m, and no downward velocity was observed in or below the
thermocline.</p>

<li><p>Changes in wind stress produce transient oscillations in the ocean
called inertial currents</p>
<p>Inertial currents are very common in the ocean.</p>
<p>The period of the current is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((2 \pi)/f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Steady winds produce a thin boundary layer, the Ekman layer, at the
top of the ocean. Ekman boundary layers also exist at the bottom of
the ocean and the atmosphere. The Ekman layer in the atmosphere
above the sea surface is called the planetary boundary layer.</p>
<p>The Ekman layer at the sea surface has the following
characteristics:</p>
<p><em>Direction</em>: 45to the right of the wind looking downwind in the
Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p><em>Surface Speed</em>: 1–2.5% of wind speed depending on latitude.</p>
<p><em>Depth</em>: approximately 40–300 m depending on latitude and wind
velocity.</p>
<p>Careful measurements of currents near the sea surface show that:</p>
<p>Inertial oscillations are the largest component of the current in
the mixed layer.</p>
<p>The flow is nearly independent of depth within the mixed layer for
periods near the inertial period. Thus the mixed layer moves like a
slab at the inertial period.</p>
<p>An Ekman layer exists in the atmosphere just above the sea (and
land) surface.</p>
<p>Surface drifters tend to drift parallel to lines of constant
atmospheric pressure at the sea surface. This is consistent with
Ekman’s theory.</p>
<p>The flow averaged over many inertial periods is almost exactly that
calculated from Ekman’s theory.</p>
<p>Transport is 90 to the right of the wind in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Spatial variability of Ekman transport, due to spatial variability
of winds over distances of hundreds of kilometers and days, leads to
convergence and divergence of the transport.</p>
<p>Winds blowing toward the equator along west coasts of continents
produces upwelling along the coast. This leads to cold, productive
waters within about 100 km of the shore.</p>
<p>Upwelled water along west coasts of continents modifies the weather
along the west coasts.</p>
<p>Ekman pumping, which is driven by spatial variability of winds,
drives a vertical current, which drives the interior geostrophic
circulation of the ocean.</p>
