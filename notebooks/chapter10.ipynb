    "# Geostrophic Currents\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the ocean’s interior away from the top and bottom Ekman layers,\n",
    "for horizontal distances exceeding a few tens of kilometers, and for\n",
    "times exceeding a few days, horizontal pressure gradients in the ocean\n",
    "almost exactly balance the Coriolis force resulting from horizontal\n",
    "currents. This balance is known as the *geostrophic balance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant forces acting in the vertical are the vertical pressure\n",
    "gradient and the weight of the water. The two balance within a few parts\n",
    "per million. Thus pressure at any point in the water column is due\n",
    "almost entirely to the weight of the water in the column above the\n",
    "point. The dominant forces in the horizontal are the pressure gradient\n",
    "and the Coriolis force. They balance within a few parts per thousand\n",
    "over large distances and times (See Box).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both balances require that viscosity and nonlinear terms in the\n",
    "equations of motion be negligible. Is this reasonable? Consider\n",
    "viscosity. We know that a rowboat weighing a hundred kilograms will\n",
    "coast for maybe ten meters after the rower stops. A super tanker moving\n",
    "at the speed of a rowboat may coast for kilometers. It seems reasonable,\n",
    "therefore that a cubic kilometer of water weighing $10^{15}$ kg would\n",
    "coast for perhaps a day before slowing to a stop. And oceanic mesoscale\n",
    "eddies contain perhaps 1000 cubic kilometers of water. Hence, our\n",
    "intuition may lead us to conclude that neglect of viscosity is\n",
    "reasonable. Of course, intuition can be wrong, and we need to refer back\n",
    "to scaling arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hydrostatic Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Before describing the geostrophic balance, let’s first consider the\n",
    "simplest solution of the momentum equation, the solution for an ocean at\n",
    "rest. It gives the hydrostatic pressure within the ocean. To obtain the\n",
    "solution, we assume the fluid is stationary: $$u=v=w=0;$$ the fluid\n",
    "remains stationary: $$\\frac{du}{dt}=\\frac{dv}{dt}=\\frac{dw}{dt} = 0;$$\n",
    "and, there is no friction: $$f_x=f_y=f_z=0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions the momentum equation (7.12) becomes:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}=0; \\qquad \\qquad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}=0; \\qquad \\qquad\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}=-\\,g(\\varphi,z)$$ where I\n",
    "have explicitly noted that gravity $g$ is a function of latitude\n",
    "$\\varphi$ and height $z$. I will show later why I have kept this\n",
    "explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations (10.4) require surfaces of constant pressure to be level\n",
    "surface (see page 30). A surface of constant pressure is an *isobaric\n",
    "surface*. The last equation can be integrated to obtain the pressure at\n",
    "any depth $h$. Recalling that $\\rho$ is a function of depth for an ocean\n",
    "at rest. $$p=\\int_{-h}^0\\,g(\\varphi,z)\\,\\rho(z)\\,dz$$ For many purposes,\n",

    "that (10.5) applies with an accuracy of about one part per million even\n",
    "if the ocean is not at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa). A bar is another unit of\n",
    "pressure. One bar is exactly $10^5$ Pa (table 10.1). Because the depth\n",
    "in meters and pressure in decibars are almost the same numerically,\n",
    "oceanographers prefer to state pressure in decibars.\n",

    "$f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\\zeta$ is the height of the sea\n",

    "\n",
    "##### The Oceanic Topography\n",
    "\n",
    "In §3.4 we define the topography of the sea surface $\\zeta$ to be the\n",
    "height of the sea surface relative to a particular level surface, the\n",
    "geoid; and we defined the geoid to be the level surface that coincided\n",
    "with the surface of the ocean at rest. Thus, according to (10.10) the\n",
    "surface geostrophic currents are proportional to the slope of the\n",
    "topography (figure 10.2), a quantity that can be measured by satellite\n",
    "altimeters if the geoid is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.2 The\n",
    "\n",
    "slope of the sea surface relative to the geoid\n",
    "$(\\partial\\zeta/\\partial x)$ is directly related to surface geostrophic\n",
    "currents $v_s$. The slope of 1 meter per 100 kilometers (10 $\\mu$rad) is\n",
    "typical of strong currents. $V_s$ is into the paper in the northern\n",
    "hemisphere. <span id=\"fig:geostrophicsketch\" label=\"fig:geostrophicsketch\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the geoid is a level surface, it is a surface of constant\n",
    "geopotential. To see this, consider the work done in moving a mass $m$\n",
    "by a distance $h$ perpendicular to a level surface. The work is $W=mgh$,\n",
    "and the change of potential energy per unit mass is $gh$. Thus level\n",
    "surfaces are surfaces of constant geopotential, where the *geopotential*\n",
    "$\\Phi = gh$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topography is due to processes that cause the ocean to move: tides,\n",
    "ocean currents, and the changes in barometric pressure that produce the\n",
    "inverted barometer effect. Because the ocean’s topography is due to\n",
    "dynamical processes, it is usually called *dynamic topography*. The\n",
    "topography is approximately one hundredth of the geoid undulations. Thus\n",
    "the shape of the sea surface is dominated by local variations of\n",
    "gravity. The influence of currents is much smaller. Typically,\n",
    "sea-surface topography has amplitude of $\\pm$<!-- -->1m (figure\n",
    "10.3). Typical slopes are $\\partial\\zeta/\\partial x \\approx$ 1–10\n",

    "## Geostrophic Currents From Hydrography\n",
    "\n",
    "The geostrophic equations are widely used in oceanography to calculate\n",
    "currents at depth. The basic idea is to use hydrographic measurements of\n",
    "temperature, salinity or conductivity, and pressure to calculate the\n",
    "density field of the ocean using the equation of state of sea water.\n",
    "Density is used in (10.7b) to calculate the internal pressure field,\n",
    "from which the geostrophic currents are calculated using (10.8a, b).\n",
    "Usually, however, the constant of integration in (10.8) is not known,\n",
    "and only the relative velocity field can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may ask, why not just measure pressure directly as is\n",
    "done in meteorology, where direct measurements of pressure are used to\n",
    "calculate winds. And, aren’t pressure measurements needed to calculate\n",
    "density from the equation of state? The answer is that very small\n",
    "changes in depth make large changes in pressure because water is so\n",
    "heavy. Errors in pressure caused by errors in determining the depth of a\n",
    "pressure gauge are much larger than the pressure due to currents. For\n",
    "example, using (10.7a), we calculate that the pressure gradient due to a\n",
    "10 cm/s current at 30latitude is $7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ Pa/m, which is 750 Pa in 100 km. From the hydrostatic\n",
    "equation (10.5), 750 Pa is equivalent to a change of depth of 7.4 cm.\n",
    "Therefore, for this example, we must know the depth of a pressure gauge\n",
    "with an accuracy of much better than 7.4 cm. This is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Geopotential Surfaces Within the Ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation of pressure gradients within the ocean must be done along\n",
    "surfaces of constant geopotential just as we calculated surface pressure\n",
    "gradients relative to the geoid when we calculated surface geostrophic\n",
    "currents. As long ago as 1910, Vilhelm Bjerknes (Bjerknes and Sandstrom,\n",
    "1910) realized that such surfaces are not at fixed heights in the\n",
    "atmosphere because $g$ is not constant, and (10.4) must include the\n",
    "variability of gravity in both the horizontal and vertical directions\n",
    "(Saunders and Fofonoff, 1976) when calculating pressure in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *geopotential $\\Phi$* is: $$\\Phi =\\int_0^z\\,g dz$$ Because\n",
    "$\\Phi/9.8$ in SI units has almost the same numerical value as height in\n",
    "meters, the meteorological community accepted Bjerknes’ proposal that\n",
    "height be replaced by *dynamic meters* $D = \\Phi/10$ to obtain a natural\n",
    "vertical coordinate. Later, this was replaced by the *geopotential\n",
    "meter* (gpm) $Z = \\Phi/9.80$. The geopotential meter is a measure of the work required\n",
    "to lift a unit mass from sea level to a height $z$ against the force of\n",
    "gravity. Harald Sverdrup, Bjerknes’ student, carried the concept to\n",
    "oceanography, and depths in the ocean are often quoted in geopotential\n",
    "meters. The difference between depths of constant vertical distance and\n",
    "constant potential can be relatively large. For example, the geometric\n",
    "depth of the 1000 dynamic meter surface is 1017.40 m at the north pole\n",
    "and 1022.78 m at the equator, a difference of 5.38 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that depth in geopotential meters, depth in meters, and pressure in\n",
    "decibars are almost the same numerically. At a depth of 1 meter the\n",

    "## Comments on Geostrophic Currents\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to calculate geostrophic currents from hydrographic\n",
    "data, let’s consider some of the limitations of the theory and\n",
    "techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Converting Relative Velocity to Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrographic data give geostrophic currents relative to geostrophic\n",
    "currents at some reference level. How can we convert the relative\n",
    "geostrophic velocities to velocities relative to the earth?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assume a Level of no Motion*: Traditionally, oceanographers assume\n",
    "there is a **level of no motion**, sometimes called a **reference\n",
    "surface**, roughly 2,000 m below the surface. This is the assumption\n",
    "used to derive the currents in table 10.4. Currents are assumed to be\n",
    "zero at this depth, and relative currents are integrated up to the\n",
    "surface and down to the bottom to obtain current velocity as a function\n",
    "of depth. There is some experimental evidence that such a level exists\n",
    "on average for mean currents (see for example, Defant, 1961: 492).\n",
    "\n",
    "Defant recommends choosing a reference level where the current shear in\n",
    "the vertical is smallest. This is usually near 2 km. This leads to\n",
    "useful maps of surface currents because surface currents tend to be\n",
    "faster than deeper currents. Figure 10.9 shows the geopotential anomaly\n",
    "and surface currents in the Pacific relative to the 1,000 dbar pressure\n",
    "level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.9. Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "geopotential anomaly relative to the 1,000 dbar surface in the Pacific\n",
    "based on 36,356 observations. Height of the anomaly is in geopotential\n",
    "centimeters. If the velocity at 1,000 dbar were zero, the map would be\n",
    "the surface topography of the Pacific. After Wyrtki (1979).\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:wyrtkiplot\" label=\"fig:wyrtkiplot\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use known currents:* The known currents could be measured by current\n",
    "meters or by satellite altimetry. Problems arise if the currents are not\n",
    "measured at the same time as the hydrographic data. For example, the\n",
    "hydrographic data may have been collected over a period of months to\n",
    "decades, while the currents may have been measured over a period of only\n",
    "a few months. Hence, the hydrography may not be consistent with the\n",
    "current measurements. Sometimes currents and hydrographic data are\n",
    "measured at nearly the same time (figure 10.10). In this example,\n",
    "currents were measured continuously by moored current meters (points) in\n",
    "a deep western boundary current and calculated from <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span>\n",
    "data taken just after the current meters were deployed and just before\n",
    "they were recovered (smooth curves). The solid line is the current\n",
    "assuming a level of no motion at 2,000 m, the dotted line is the current\n",
    "adjusted using the current meter observations smoothed for various\n",
    "intervals before or after the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span> casts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.10 Current\n",
    "\n",
    "meter measurements can be used with <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span> measurements to\n",
    "determine current as a function of depth avoiding the need for assuming\n",
    "a depth of no motion. Solid line: profile assuming a depth of no motion\n",
    "at 2000 decibars. Dashed line: profile adjusted to agree with currents\n",
    "measured by current meters 1–7 days before the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span>\n",
    "measurements. (Plots from Tom Whitworth, Texas A&M University)\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:whitplot\" label=\"fig:whitplot\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use Conservation Equations*: Lines of hydrographic stations across a\n",
    "strait or an ocean basin may be used with conservation of mass and salt\n",
    "to calculate currents. This is an example of an inverse problem (Wunsch,\n",
    "1996 describes the application of inverse methods in oceanography). See\n",
    "Mercier et al. (2003) for a description of how they determined the\n",
    "circulation in the upper layers of the eastern basins of the south\n",
    "Atlantic using hydrographic data from the World Ocean Circulation\n",
    "Experiment and direct measurements of current in a box model constrained\n",
    "by inverse theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantage of Calculating Currents from Hydrographic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Currents calculated from hydrographic data have been used to make maps\n",
    "of ocean currents since the early 20th century. Nevertheless, it is\n",
    "important to review the limitations of the technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydrographic data can be used to calculate only the current relative to\n",
    "a current at another level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of a level of no motion may be suitable in the deep\n",
    "ocean, but it is usually not a useful assumption when the water is\n",
    "shallow such as over the continental shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geostrophic currents cannot be calculated from hydrographic stations\n",
    "that are close together. Stations must be tens of kilometers apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limitations of the Geostrophic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "I began this section by showing that the geostrophic balance applies\n",
    "with good accuracy to flows that exceed a few tens of kilometers in\n",
    "extent and with periods greater than a few days. The balance cannot,\n",
    "however, be perfect. If it were, the flow in the ocean would never\n",
    "change because the balance ignores any acceleration of the flow. The\n",
    "important limitations of the geostrophic assumption are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geostrophic currents cannot evolve with time because the balance ignores\n",
    "acceleration of the flow. Acceleration dominates if the horizontal\n",
    "dimensions are less than roughly 50 km and times are less than a few\n",
    "days. Acceleration is negligible, but not zero, over longer times and\n",
    "distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geostrophic balance does not apply within about 2 of the equator\n",
    "where the Coriolis force goes to zero because\n",
    "$\\sin \\varphi \\rightarrow 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geostrophic balance ignores the influence of friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Strub et al. (1997) showed that currents calculated from satellite\n",
    "altimeter measurements of sea-surface slope have an accuracy of\n",
    "$\\pm$<!-- -->3–5 cm/s. Uchida, Imawaki, and Hu (1998) compared\n",
    "currents measured by drifters in the Kuroshio with currents calculated\n",
    "from satellite altimeter data assuming geostrophic balance. Using slopes\n",
    "over distances of 12.5 km, they found the difference between the two\n",
    "measurements was $\\pm$<!-- -->16 cm/s for currents up to 150\n",
    "cm/s, or about 10%. Johns, Watts, and Rossby (1989) measured the\n",
    "velocity of the Gulf Stream northeast of Cape Hatteras and compared the\n",
    "measurements with velocity calculated from hydrographic data assuming\n",
    "geostrophic balance. They found that the measured velocity in the core\n",
    "of the stream, at depths less than 500 m, was 10–25 cm/s faster than\n",
    "the velocity calculated from the geostrophic equations using measured\n",
    "velocities at a depth of 2000 m. The maximum velocity in the core was\n",
    "greater than 150 cm/s, so the error was $\\approx 10$%. When they added\n",
    "the influence of the curvature of the Gulf Stream, which adds an\n",
    "acceleration term to the geostrophic equations, the difference in the\n",
    "calculated and observed velocity dropped to less than 5–10 cm/s\n",
    "($\\approx 5$%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Currents From Hydrographic Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines of hydrographic data along ship tracks are often used to produce\n",
    "contour plots of density in a vertical section along the track.\n",
    "Cross-sections of currents sometimes show sharply dipping density\n",
    "surfaces with a large contrast in density on either side of the current.\n",
    "The baroclinic currents in the section can be estimated using a\n",
    "technique first proposed by Margules (1906) and described by Defant\n",
    "(1961: 453). The technique allows oceanographers to estimate the speed\n",
    "and direction of currents perpendicular to the section by a quick look\n",
    "at the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive Margules’ equation, consider the slope $\\partial z/\\partial x$ of a stationary interface between two water masses with densities\n",
    "$\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$ (see figure 10.11). To calculate the change in\n",
    "velocity across the interface we assume homogeneous layers of density\n",
    "$\\rho_1 < \\rho_2$ both of which are in geostrophic equilibrium. Although\n",
    "the ocean does not have an idealized interface that we assumed, and the\n",
    "water masses do not have uniform density, and the interface between the\n",
    "water masses is not sharp, the concept is still useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Oceanography and fluid mechanics distinguish between two techniques for\n",
    "measuring currents: Lagrangian and Eulerian. Lagrangian techniques\n",
    "follow a water particle. Eulerian techniques measure the velocity of\n",
    "water at a fixed position.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Lagrangian techniques track the position of a drifter designed to follow\n",
    "a water parcel either on the surface or deeper within the water column.\n",
    "The mean velocity over some period is calculated from the distance\n",
    "between positions at the beginning and end of the period divided by the\n",
    "period. Errors are due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure of the drifter to follow a parcel of water. We assume the\n",
    "drifter stays in a parcel of water, but wind blowing on the surface\n",
    "float of a surface drifter can cause the drifter to move relative to the\n",
    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in determining the position of the drifter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling errors. Drifters go only where drifters want to go. And\n",
    "drifters want to go to convergent zones. Hence drifters tend to avoid\n",
    "areas of divergent flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.13 System\n",
    "\n",
    "Argos uses radio signals transmitted from surface buoys to determine the\n",
    "position of the buoy. A satellite receives the signal from the buoy B.\n",
    "The time rate of change of the signal, the Doppler shift $F$, is a\n",
    "function of buoy position and distance from the satellite’s track. Note\n",
    "that a buoy at BB would produce the same Doppler shift as the buoy at B.\n",
    "The recorded Doppler signal is transmitted to ground stations E, which\n",

    "##### Satellite Tracked Surface Drifters\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface drifters consist of a drogue plus a float. Its position is\n",
    "determined by the Argos system on meteorological satellites (Swenson and\n",
    "Shaw, 1990) or calculated from <span class=\"smallcaps\">gps</span> data recorded\n",
    "continuously by the buoy and relayed to shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argos-tracked buoys carry a radio transmitter with a very stable\n",
    "frequency $F_0$. A receiver on the satellite receives the signal and\n",
    "determines the Doppler shift $F$ as a function of time $t$ (figure\n",
    "10.13). The Doppler frequency is\n",
    "$$F=\\frac{dR}{dt}\\,\\frac{F_0}{c} + F_0$$ where $R$ is the distance to\n",
    "the buoy, $c$ is the velocity of light. The closer the buoy to the\n",
    "satellite the more rapidly the frequency changes. When $F = F_0$ the\n",
    "range is a minimum. This is the time of closest approach, and the\n",
    "satellite’s velocity vector is perpendicular to the line from the\n",
    "satellite to the buoy. The time of closest approach and the time rate of\n",
    "change of Doppler frequency at that time gives the buoy’s position\n",
    "relative to the orbit with a 180 ambiguity (B and BB in the figure).\n",
    "Because the orbit is accurately known, and because the buoy can be\n",
    "observed many times, its position can be determined without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the calculated position depends on the stability of the\n",
    "frequency transmitted by the buoy. The Argos system tracks buoys with an\n",
    "accuracy of $\\pm$(1–2) km, collecting 1–8 positions per day depending\n",
    "on latitude. Because 1 cm/s $\\approx$ 1 km/day, and because typical\n",
    "values of currents in the ocean range from one to two hundred\n",
    "centimeters per second, this is an very useful accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Holey-Sock Drifters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used, satellite-tracked drifter is the holey-sock\n",
    "drifter. It consists of a cylindrical drogue of cloth 1 m in diameter by\n",
    "15 m long with 14 large holes cut in the sides. The weight of the drogue\n",
    "is supported by a float set 3 m below the surface. The submerged float\n",
    "is tethered to a partially submerged surface float carrying the Argos\n",
    "transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The buoy was designed for the Surface Velocity Program and extensively\n",
    "tested. Niiler et al. (1995) carefully measured the rate at which wind\n",
    "blowing on the surface float pulls the drogue through the water, and\n",
    "they found that the buoy moves $12\\pm9$ to the right of the wind at a\n",
    "speed\n",
    "$$U_s = \\left( 4.32\\pm 0.67 \\times\\right) 10^{-2} \\frac{U_{10}}{DAR} +\n",

    "area ratio defined as the drogue’s drag area divided by the sum of the\n",
    "tether’s drag area and the surface float’s drag area, and $D$ is the\n",
    "difference in velocity of the water between the top of the cylindrical\n",
    "drogue and the bottom. Drifters typically have a $DAR$ of 40, and the\n",
    "drift $U_s < 1$ cm/s for $U_{10} < 10$ m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Argo Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used subsurface floats are the Argo floats. The floats\n",
    "(figure 10.14) are designed to cycle between the surface and some\n",
    "predetermined depth. Most floats drift for 10 days at a depth of 1 km,\n",
    "sink to 2 km, then rise to the surface. While rising, they profile\n",
    "temperature and salinity as a function of pressure (depth). The floats\n",
    "remains on the surface for a few hours, relays data to shore via the\n",
    "Argos system, then sink again to 1 km. Each float carries enough power\n",
    "to repeat this cycle for several years. The float thus measures currents\n",
    "at 1 km depth and density distribution in the upper ocean. Three\n",

    "mooring shown on the right in the figure is preferred for several\n",

    "\n",
    "The most common Eulerian measurements of currents are made using sound.\n",
    "Typically, the current meter or profiler transmits sound in three or\n",
    "four narrow beams pointed in different directions. Plankton and tiny\n",
    "bubbles reflect the sound back to the instrument. The Doppler shift of\n",

    "distances from the instrument using sound beams projected into the water\n",
    "just as a radar measures radio scatter as a function of range using\n",
    "radio beams projected into the air. Data from the beams are combined to\n",
    "give profiles of current velocity as a function of distance from the\n",
    "instrument. On ships, the beams are pointed diagonally downward at 3–4\n",
    "horizontal angles relative to the ship’s bow. Bottom-mounted meters use\n",
    "beams pointed diagonally upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ship-board instruments are widely used to profile currents within 200 to\n",
    "300 m of the sea surface while the ship steams between hydrographic\n",

    "1.  Pressure distribution is almost precisely the hydrostatic pressure\n",
    "    obtained by assuming the ocean is at rest. Pressure is therefore\n",
    "    calculated very accurately from measurements of temperature and\n",
    "    conductivity as a function of pressure using the equation of state\n",
    "    of seawater. Hydrographic data give the relative, internal pressure\n",
    "    field of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flow in the ocean is in almost exact geostrophic balance except for\n",
    "    flow in the upper and lower boundary layers. Coriolis force almost\n",
    "    exactly balances the horizontal pressure gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Satellite altimetric observations of the oceanic topography give the\n",
    "    surface geostrophic current. The calculation of topography requires\n",
    "    an accurate geoid. If the geoid is not known, altimeters can measure\n",
    "    the change in topography as a function of time, which gives the\n",
    "    change in surface geostrophic currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Topex/Poseidon and Jason are the most accurate altimeter systems,\n",
    "    and they can measure the topography or changes in topography with an\n",
    "    accuracy of $\\pm$<!-- -->4 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hydrographic data are used to calculate the internal geostrophic\n",
    "    currents in the ocean relative to known currents at some level. The\n",
    "    level can be surface currents measured by altimetry or an assumed\n",
    "    level of no motion at depths below 1–2 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flow in the ocean that is independent of depth is called barotropic\n",
    "    flow, flow that depends on depth is called baroclinic flow.\n",
    "    Hydrographic data give only the baroclinic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Geostrophic flow cannot change with time, so the flow in the ocean\n",
    "    is not exactly geostrophic. The geostrophic method does not apply to\n",
    "    flows at the equator where the Coriolis force vanishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Slopes of constant density or temperature surfaces seen in a\n",
    "    cross-section of the ocean can be used to estimate the speed of flow\n",
    "    through the section.\n",

    "    Lagrangian techniques measure the position of a parcel of water in\n",
    "    the ocean. The position can be determined using surface drifters or\n",
    "    subsurface floats, or chemical tracers such as tritium.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Eulerian techniques measure the velocity of flow past a point in the\n",
    "    ocean. The velocity of the flow can be measured using moored current\n",
    "    meters or acoustic velocity profilers on ships, <span class=\"smallcaps\">ctd</span>s\n",
