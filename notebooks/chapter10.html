<p>Within the ocean’s interior away from the top and bottom Ekman layers,
for horizontal distances exceeding a few tens of kilometers, and for
times exceeding a few days, horizontal pressure gradients in the ocean
almost exactly balance the Coriolis force resulting from horizontal
currents. This balance is known as the <em>geostrophic balance</em>.</p>
<p>The dominant forces acting in the vertical are the vertical pressure
gradient and the weight of the water. The two balance within a few parts
per million. Thus pressure at any point in the water column is due
almost entirely to the weight of the water in the column above the
point. The dominant forces in the horizontal are the pressure gradient
and the Coriolis force. They balance within a few parts per thousand
over large distances and times (See Box).</p>
<p>Both balances require that viscosity and nonlinear terms in the
equations of motion be negligible. Is this reasonable? Consider
viscosity. We know that a rowboat weighing a hundred kilograms will
coast for maybe ten meters after the rower stops. A super tanker moving
at the speed of a rowboat may coast for kilometers. It seems reasonable,
therefore that a cubic kilometer of water weighing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{15}\)</span> kg would
coast for perhaps a day before slowing to a stop. And oceanic mesoscale
eddies contain perhaps 1000 cubic kilometers of water. Hence, our
intuition may lead us to conclude that neglect of viscosity is
reasonable. Of course, intuition can be wrong, and we need to refer back
to scaling arguments.</p>

<p>Before describing the geostrophic balance, let’s first consider the
simplest solution of the momentum equation, the solution for an ocean at
rest. It gives the hydrostatic pressure within the ocean. To obtain the

<p>If the ocean is homogeneous and density and gravity are constant, the
first term on the right-hand side of (10.8) is equal to zero; and the
horizontal pressure gradients within the ocean are the same as the
gradient at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z = 0\)</span>. This is barotropic flow described in §10.4.</p>
<p>If the ocean is stratified, the horizontal pressure gradient has two
terms, one due to the slope at the sea surface, and an additional term
due to horizontal density differences. These equations include
baroclinic flow also discussed in §10.4. The first term on the

<h3><span class="section-number">10.3.1. </span>The Oceanic Topography<a class="headerlink" href="#the-oceanic-topography" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In §3.4 we define the topography of the sea surface <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> to be the
height of the sea surface relative to a particular level surface, the
geoid; and we defined the geoid to be the level surface that coincided
with the surface of the ocean at rest. Thus, according to (10.10) the
surface geostrophic currents are proportional to the slope of the
topography (figure 10.2), a quantity that can be measured by satellite
altimeters if the geoid is known.</p>
<p>Figure 10.2 The</p>
<p>slope of the sea surface relative to the geoid
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\partial\zeta/\partial x)\)</span> is directly related to surface geostrophic
currents <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_s\)</span>. The slope of 1 meter per 100 kilometers (10 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>rad) is
typical of strong currents. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_s\)</span> is into the paper in the northern
hemisphere. <span id="fig:geostrophicsketch" label="fig:geostrophicsketch"></span></p>
<p>Because the geoid is a level surface, it is a surface of constant
geopotential. To see this, consider the work done in moving a mass <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>
by a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> perpendicular to a level surface. The work is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W=mgh\)</span>,
and the change of potential energy per unit mass is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(gh\)</span>. Thus level
surfaces are surfaces of constant geopotential, where the <em>geopotential</em>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Phi = gh\)</span>.</p>
<p>Topography is due to processes that cause the ocean to move: tides,
ocean currents, and the changes in barometric pressure that produce the
inverted barometer effect. Because the ocean’s topography is due to
dynamical processes, it is usually called <em>dynamic topography</em>. The
topography is approximately one hundredth of the geoid undulations. Thus
the shape of the sea surface is dominated by local variations of
gravity. The influence of currents is much smaller. Typically,
sea-surface topography has amplitude of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->1m (figure
10.3). Typical slopes are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial\zeta/\partial x \approx\)</span> 1–10
microradians for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v =\)</span> 0.1–1.0 m/s at mid latitude.</p>

roughly 400 km, is known with an accuracy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->1mm

<p>Very accurate, satellite-altimeter systems are needed for measuring the
oceanic topography. The first systems, carried on Seasat, Geosat,
<span class="smallcaps">ers</span>–1, and <span class="smallcaps">ers</span>–2 were designed to measure
week-to-week variability of currents. Topex/Poseidon, launched in 1992,
was the first satellite designed to make the much more accurate
measurements necessary for observing the permanent (time-averaged)
surface circulation of the ocean, tides, and the variability of
gyre-scale currents. It was followed in 2001 by Jason and in 2008 by
Jason-2.</p>
<p>Because the geoid was not well known locally before about 2004,
altimeters were usually flown in orbits that have an exactly repeating
ground track. Thus Topex/Poseidon and Jason fly over the same ground
track every 9.9156 days. By subtracting sea-surface height from one
traverse of the ground track from height measured on a later traverse,
changes in topography can be observed without knowing the geoid. The
geoid is constant in time, and the subtraction removes the geoid,
revealing changes due to changing currents, such as mesoscale eddies,
assuming tides have been removed from the data (figure 10.4). Mesoscale
variability includes eddies with diameters between roughly 20 and 500
km.</p>

<p>The most accurate observations of the sea-surface topography are from

<p>Instrument noise, ocean waves, water vapor, free electrons in the

<p>Tracking errors. The satellites carried three tracking systems that

<p>Sampling error. The satellites measure height along a ground track that

<p>Geoid error. The permanent topography is not well known over distances
shorter than a hundred kilometers because geoid errors dominate for

<p>The geostrophic equations are widely used in oceanography to calculate
currents at depth. The basic idea is to use hydrographic measurements of
temperature, salinity or conductivity, and pressure to calculate the
density field of the ocean using the equation of state of sea water.
Density is used in (10.7b) to calculate the internal pressure field,
from which the geostrophic currents are calculated using (10.8a, b).
Usually, however, the constant of integration in (10.8) is not known,
and only the relative velocity field can be calculated.</p>
<p>At this point, you may ask, why not just measure pressure directly as is
done in meteorology, where direct measurements of pressure are used to
calculate winds. And, aren’t pressure measurements needed to calculate
density from the equation of state? The answer is that very small
changes in depth make large changes in pressure because water is so
heavy. Errors in pressure caused by errors in determining the depth of a
pressure gauge are much larger than the pressure due to currents. For
example, using (10.7a), we calculate that the pressure gradient due to a
10 cm/s current at 30latitude is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.5 \times 10^{-3}\)</span> Pa/m, which is 750 Pa in 100 km. From the hydrostatic
equation (10.5), 750 Pa is equivalent to a change of depth of 7.4 cm.
Therefore, for this example, we must know the depth of a pressure gauge
with an accuracy of much better than 7.4 cm. This is not possible.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.4.1. </span>Geopotential Surfaces Within the Ocean<a class="headerlink" href="#geopotential-surfaces-within-the-ocean" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Calculation of pressure gradients within the ocean must be done along
surfaces of constant geopotential just as we calculated surface pressure
gradients relative to the geoid when we calculated surface geostrophic
currents. As long ago as 1910, Vilhelm Bjerknes (Bjerknes and Sandstrom,
1910) realized that such surfaces are not at fixed heights in the
atmosphere because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> is not constant, and (10.4) must include the
variability of gravity in both the horizontal and vertical directions
(Saunders and Fofonoff, 1976) when calculating pressure in the ocean.</p>
<p>The <em>geopotential <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Phi\)</span></em> is: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Phi =\int_0^z\,g dz\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Because
\)</span>\Phi/9.8<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( in SI units has almost the same numerical value as height in

vertical coordinate. Later, this was replaced by the *geopotential
meter* (gpm) \)</span>Z = \Phi/9.80<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. The geopotential meter is a measure of the work required
to lift a unit mass from sea level to a height \)</span>z$ against the force of
gravity. Harald Sverdrup, Bjerknes’ student, carried the concept to
oceanography, and depths in the ocean are often quoted in geopotential
meters. The difference between depths of constant vertical distance and
constant potential can be relatively large. For example, the geometric
depth of the 1000 dynamic meter surface is 1017.40 m at the north pole
and 1022.78 m at the equator, a difference of 5.38 m.</p>
<p>Note that depth in geopotential meters, depth in meters, and pressure in
decibars are almost the same numerically. At a depth of 1 meter the
pressure is approximately 1.007 decibars and the depth is 1.00
geopotential meters.</p>

<p>To calculate geostrophic currents, we need to calculate the horizontal
pressure gradient within the ocean. This can be done using either of two
approaches:</p>
<p>Calculate the slope of a constant pressure surface relative to a surface
of constant geopotential. We used this approach when we used sea-surface
slope from altimetry to calculate surface geostrophic currents. The sea
surface is a constant-pressure surface. The constant geopotential
surface was the geoid.</p>
<p>Calculate the change in pressure on a surface of constant geopotential.
Such a surface is called a <em>geopotential surface</em>.</p>
<p>Figure 10.7. Sketch of</p>
<p>geometry used for calculating geostrophic current from hydrography.</p>
<p><span id="fig:hydrosketch" label="fig:hydrosketch"></span></p>
<p>Oceanographers usually calculate the slope of constant-pressure
surfaces. The important steps are:</p>
<p>Calculate differences in geopotential <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( \Phi_A - \Phi_B \right)\)</span>
between two constant-pressure surfaces <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( P_1 , P_2 \right)\)</span> at
hydrographic stations A and B (figure 10.7). This is similar to the
calculation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> of the surface layer.</p>
<p>Calculate the slope of the upper pressure surface relative to the lower.</p>
<p>Calculate the geostrophic current at the upper surface relative to the
current at the lower. This is the current shear.</p>
<p>Integrate the current shear from some depth where currents are known to
obtain currents as a function of depth. For example, from the surface
downward, using surface geostrophic currents observed by satellite
altimetry, or upward from an assumed level of no motion.</p>
<p>To calculate geostrophic currents oceanographers use a modified form of
the hydrostatic equation. The vertical pressure gradient (10.6) is
written</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{\delta p}{\rho}=\alpha\,\delta p &amp;=-g\,\delta z \\
\alpha\,\delta p&amp;=\delta\Phi\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = \alpha(S,t,p)\)</span> is the <em>specific volume</em>, and (10.12b)
follows from (10.11). Differentiating (10.12b) with respect to
horizontal distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> allows the geostrophic balance to be written in
terms of the slope of the constant-pressure surface using (10.6) with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f = 2 \Omega \sin \phi\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Phi\)</span> is the geopotential at the constant-pressure surface.</p>
<p>Now let’s see how hydrographic data are used for evaluating
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial \Phi/\partial x\)</span> on a constant-pressure surface. Integrating
(10.12b) between two constant-pressure surfaces
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( P_1 , P_2 \right)\)</span> in the ocean as shown in figure 10.7 gives
the geopotential difference between two constant-pressure surfaces. At

The geopotential anomaly is much smaller, being approximately 0.1% of

<p>Consider now the geopotential anomaly between two pressure surfaces
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span> calculated at two hydrographic stations A and B a
distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> meters apart (figure 10.7). For simplicity we assume the
lower constant-pressure surface is a level surface. Hence the
constant-pressure and geopotential surfaces coincide, and there is no
geostrophic velocity at this depth. The slope of the upper surface is
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\Delta\Phi_B - \Delta\Phi_A}{L} =\text{slope of constant-pressure
surface \)</span>P_2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( because the standard geopotential distance is the same

\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V =\frac{\left(\Delta\Phi_B - \Delta\Phi_A\right)}{2\Omega\,L\, \sin\varphi }\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
where \)</span>V<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the velocity at the upper geopotential surface. The

stations and directed into the plane of figure 10.7 if the flow is in
the northern hemisphere. <em>A useful rule of thumb is that the flow is
such that warmer, lighter water is to the right looking downstream in
the northern hemisphere.</em></p>
<p>Note that I could have calculated the slope of the constant-pressure
surfaces using density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> instead of specific volume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>. I
used <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> because it is the common practice in oceanography, and
tables of specific volume anomalies and computer code to calculate the
anomalies are widely available. The common practice follows from
numerical methods developed before calculators and computers were
available, when all calculations were done by hand or by mechanical
calculators with the help of tables and nomograms. Because the
computation must be done with an accuracy of a few parts per million,
and because all scientific fields tend to be conservative, the common
practice has continued to use specific volume anomalies rather than
density anomalies.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.4.3. </span>Barotropic and Baroclinic Flow:<a class="headerlink" href="#barotropic-and-baroclinic-flow" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>If the ocean were homogeneous with constant density, then
constant-pressure surfaces would always be parallel to the sea surface,
and the geostrophic velocity would be independent of depth. In this case
the relative velocity is zero, and hydrographic data cannot be used to
measure the geostrophic current. If density varies with depth, but not
with horizontal distance, the constant-pressure surfaces are always
parallel to the sea surface and the levels of constant density, the
<em>isopycnal surfaces</em>. In this case, the relative flow is also zero. Both
cases are examples of <em>barotropic flow</em>.</p>
<p><em>Barotropic flow</em> occurs when levels of constant pressure in the ocean
are always parallel to the surfaces of constant density. Note, some
authors call the vertically averaged flow the barotropic component of
the flow. Wunsch (1996: 74) points out that barotropic is used in so
many different ways that the term is meaningless and should not be used.</p>
<p><em>Baroclinic flow</em> occurs when levels of constant pressure are inclined
to surfaces of constant density. In this case, density varies with depth
and horizontal position. A good example is seen in figure 10.8 which
shows levels of constant density changing depth by more than 1 km over
horizontal distances of 100 km at the Gulf Stream. Baroclinic flow
varies with depth, and the relative current can be calculated from
hydrographic data. Note, constant-density surfaces cannot be inclined to
constant-pressure surfaces for a fluid at rest.</p>
<p>In general, the variation of flow in the vertical can be decomposed into
a barotropic component which is independent of depth, and a baroclinic
component which varies with depth.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">10.5. </span>An Example Using Hydrographic Data<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example-using-hydrographic-data" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s now consider a specific numerical calculation of geostrophic
velocity using generally accepted procedures from <em>Processing of
Oceanographic Station Data</em> (<span class="smallcaps">jpots</span> Editorial Panel, 1991).
The book has worked examples using hydrographic data collected by the
<span class="smallcaps">r/v</span> <em>Endeavor</em> in the north Atlantic. Data were collected
on Cruise 88 along 71W across the Gulf Stream south of Cape Cod,
Massachusetts at stations 61 and 64. Station 61 is on the Sargasso Sea
side of the Gulf Stream in water 4260 m deep. Station 64 is north of the
Gulf Stream in water 3892 m deep. The measurements were made by a
Conductivity-Temperature-Depth-Oxygen Profiler, Mark III CTD/02, made by
Neil Brown Instruments Systems.</p>
<p>The <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span> sampled temperature, salinity, and pressure 22
times per second, and the digital data were averaged over 2 dbar
intervals as the <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span> was lowered in the water. Data were
tabulated at 2 dbar pressure intervals centered on odd values of
pressure because the first observation is at the surface, and the first
averaging interval extends to 2 dbar, and the center of the first
interval is at 1 dbar. Data were further smoothed with a binomial filter
and linearly interpolated to standard levels reported in the first three
columns of tables 10.2 and 10.3. All processing was done by computer.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta (S, t, p)\)</span> in the fifth column of tables 10.2 and 10.3 is
calculated from the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t, S, p\)</span> in the layer. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\delta &gt;\)</span> is the
average value of specific volume anomaly for the layer between standard
pressure levels. It is the average of the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta (S, t, p)\)</span> at the top and bottom of the layer (<em>cf.</em> the mean-value
theorem of calculus). The last column <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((10^{-5} \Delta\Phi)\)</span> is the product of the average specific volume anomaly of
the layer times the thickness of the layer in decibars. Therefore, the
last column is the geopotential anomaly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta \Phi\)</span> calculated by
integrating (10.16) between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_1\)</span> at the bottom of each layer and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_2\)</span>
at the top of each layer.</p>
<p>The distance between the stations is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L = 110,935\)</span> m; the average
Coriolis parameter is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f = 0.88104 \times 10^{-4}\)</span>; and the denominator
in (10.17) is 0.10231 s/m. This was used to calculate the geostrophic
currents relative to 2000 decibars reported in table 10.4 and plotted in
figure 10.8.</p>
<p>Notice that there are no Ekman currents in figure 10.8. Ekman currents
are not geostrophic, so they don’t contribute directly to the
topography. They contribute only indirectly through Ekman pumping (see
figure 12.7).</p>

<p>Now that we know how to calculate geostrophic currents from hydrographic
data, let’s consider some of the limitations of the theory and
techniques.</p>
<section id="converting-relative-velocity-to-velocity">
<h3><span class="section-number">10.6.1. </span>Converting Relative Velocity to Velocity<a class="headerlink" href="#converting-relative-velocity-to-velocity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Hydrographic data give geostrophic currents relative to geostrophic
currents at some reference level. How can we convert the relative
geostrophic velocities to velocities relative to the earth?</p>
<p><em>Assume a Level of no Motion</em>: Traditionally, oceanographers assume
there is a <strong>level of no motion</strong>, sometimes called a <strong>reference
surface</strong>, roughly 2,000 m below the surface. This is the assumption
used to derive the currents in table 10.4. Currents are assumed to be
zero at this depth, and relative currents are integrated up to the
surface and down to the bottom to obtain current velocity as a function
of depth. There is some experimental evidence that such a level exists
on average for mean currents (see for example, Defant, 1961: 492).</p>
<p>Defant recommends choosing a reference level where the current shear in
the vertical is smallest. This is usually near 2 km. This leads to
useful maps of surface currents because surface currents tend to be
faster than deeper currents. Figure 10.9 shows the geopotential anomaly
and surface currents in the Pacific relative to the 1,000 dbar pressure
level.</p>
<p>Figure 10.9. Mean</p>
<p>geopotential anomaly relative to the 1,000 dbar surface in the Pacific
based on 36,356 observations. Height of the anomaly is in geopotential
centimeters. If the velocity at 1,000 dbar were zero, the map would be
the surface topography of the Pacific. After Wyrtki (1979).
<span id="fig:wyrtkiplot" label="fig:wyrtkiplot"></span></p>
<p><em>Use known currents:</em> The known currents could be measured by current
meters or by satellite altimetry. Problems arise if the currents are not
measured at the same time as the hydrographic data. For example, the
hydrographic data may have been collected over a period of months to
decades, while the currents may have been measured over a period of only
a few months. Hence, the hydrography may not be consistent with the
current measurements. Sometimes currents and hydrographic data are
measured at nearly the same time (figure 10.10). In this example,
currents were measured continuously by moored current meters (points) in
a deep western boundary current and calculated from <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span>
data taken just after the current meters were deployed and just before
they were recovered (smooth curves). The solid line is the current
assuming a level of no motion at 2,000 m, the dotted line is the current
adjusted using the current meter observations smoothed for various
intervals before or after the <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span> casts.</p>
<p>Figure 10.10 Current</p>
<p>meter measurements can be used with <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span> measurements to
determine current as a function of depth avoiding the need for assuming
a depth of no motion. Solid line: profile assuming a depth of no motion
at 2000 decibars. Dashed line: profile adjusted to agree with currents
measured by current meters 1–7 days before the <span class="smallcaps">ctd</span>
measurements. (Plots from Tom Whitworth, Texas A&amp;M University)
<span id="fig:whitplot" label="fig:whitplot"></span></p>
<p><em>Use Conservation Equations</em>: Lines of hydrographic stations across a
strait or an ocean basin may be used with conservation of mass and salt
to calculate currents. This is an example of an inverse problem (Wunsch,
1996 describes the application of inverse methods in oceanography). See
Mercier et al. (2003) for a description of how they determined the
circulation in the upper layers of the eastern basins of the south
Atlantic using hydrographic data from the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment and direct measurements of current in a box model constrained
by inverse theory.</p>

<p>Currents calculated from hydrographic data have been used to make maps
of ocean currents since the early 20th century. Nevertheless, it is
important to review the limitations of the technique.</p>
<p>Hydrographic data can be used to calculate only the current relative to
a current at another level.</p>
<p>The assumption of a level of no motion may be suitable in the deep
ocean, but it is usually not a useful assumption when the water is
shallow such as over the continental shelf.</p>
<p>Geostrophic currents cannot be calculated from hydrographic stations
that are close together. Stations must be tens of kilometers apart.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.6.3. </span>Limitations of the Geostrophic Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-of-the-geostrophic-equations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I began this section by showing that the geostrophic balance applies
with good accuracy to flows that exceed a few tens of kilometers in
extent and with periods greater than a few days. The balance cannot,
however, be perfect. If it were, the flow in the ocean would never
change because the balance ignores any acceleration of the flow. The
important limitations of the geostrophic assumption are:</p>
<p>Geostrophic currents cannot evolve with time because the balance ignores
acceleration of the flow. Acceleration dominates if the horizontal
dimensions are less than roughly 50 km and times are less than a few
days. Acceleration is negligible, but not zero, over longer times and
distances.</p>
<p>The geostrophic balance does not apply within about 2 of the equator
where the Coriolis force goes to zero because
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sin \varphi \rightarrow 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The geostrophic balance ignores the influence of friction.</p>

<p>Strub et al. (1997) showed that currents calculated from satellite
altimeter measurements of sea-surface slope have an accuracy of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->3–5 cm/s. Uchida, Imawaki, and Hu (1998) compared
currents measured by drifters in the Kuroshio with currents calculated
from satellite altimeter data assuming geostrophic balance. Using slopes
over distances of 12.5 km, they found the difference between the two
measurements was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->16 cm/s for currents up to 150
cm/s, or about 10%. Johns, Watts, and Rossby (1989) measured the
velocity of the Gulf Stream northeast of Cape Hatteras and compared the
measurements with velocity calculated from hydrographic data assuming
geostrophic balance. They found that the measured velocity in the core
of the stream, at depths less than 500 m, was 10–25 cm/s faster than
the velocity calculated from the geostrophic equations using measured
velocities at a depth of 2000 m. The maximum velocity in the core was
greater than 150 cm/s, so the error was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 10\)</span>%. When they added
the influence of the curvature of the Gulf Stream, which adds an
acceleration term to the geostrophic equations, the difference in the
calculated and observed velocity dropped to less than 5–10 cm/s
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx 5\)</span>%).</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">10.7. </span>Currents From Hydrographic Sections<a class="headerlink" href="#currents-from-hydrographic-sections" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Lines of hydrographic data along ship tracks are often used to produce
contour plots of density in a vertical section along the track.
Cross-sections of currents sometimes show sharply dipping density
surfaces with a large contrast in density on either side of the current.
The baroclinic currents in the section can be estimated using a
technique first proposed by Margules (1906) and described by Defant
(1961: 453). The technique allows oceanographers to estimate the speed
and direction of currents perpendicular to the section by a quick look
at the section.</p>
<p>To derive Margules’ equation, consider the slope <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial z/\partial x\)</span> of a stationary interface between two water masses with densities
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_2\)</span> (see figure 10.11). To calculate the change in
velocity across the interface we assume homogeneous layers of density
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_1 &lt; \rho_2\)</span> both of which are in geostrophic equilibrium. Although
the ocean does not have an idealized interface that we assumed, and the
water masses do not have uniform density, and the interface between the
water masses is not sharp, the concept is still useful in practice.</p>
<p>Figure 10.11 Slopes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> of the</p>
<p>sea surface and the slope <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> of the interface between two
homogeneous, moving layers, with density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_1\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_2\)</span> in the
northern hemisphere. After Neumann and Pierson (1966: 166)</p>
<p><span id="fig:Fig10-10" label="fig:Fig10-10"></span></p>
<p>The change in pressure on the interface is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta p = \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\,\delta x + \frac{\partial p}{\partial
z}\, \delta z ,\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and the vertical and horizontal pressure gradients are
obtained from (10.6):
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}= - \rho_1 g + \rho_1 f v_1\)</span>$ Therefore:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\delta p_1&amp;=-\rho_1fv_1 \, \delta x + \rho_1 g \, \delta z \\
\delta p_2&amp;=-\rho_2fv_2 \, \delta x + \rho_2 g \, \delta z \\ \notag\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The boundary conditions require <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta p_1 = \delta p_2\)</span> on the
interface if the interface is not moving. Equating (10.20a) with
(10.20b), dividing by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta x\)</span>, and solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta z/\delta x\)</span>
gives:
$$\frac{\delta z}{\delta x}\equiv \tan \gamma =\frac{f}{g}\left(\frac{\rho_2,v_2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>\rho_1,v_1}{\rho_2 -\rho_1}\right)$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Because \)</span>\rho_1 \approx \rho_2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(,
and for small \)</span>\beta<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and \)</span>\gamma$,</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\tan \gamma &amp;\approx \frac{f}{g}\left(\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2 - \rho_1}\right)(v_2-v_1) \\
\tan \beta_1&amp;=-\frac{f}{g}\, v_1 \\
\tan \beta_2&amp;=-\frac{f}{g}\, v_2\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> is the slope of the sea surface, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is the slope
of the interface between the two water masses. Because the internal
differences in density are small, the slope is approximately 1000 times
larger than the slope of the constant pressure surfaces.</p>
<p>Consider the application of the technique to the Gulf Stream (figure
10.8). From the figure: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi = 36\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_1 = 1026.7\)</span> kg/m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_2 = 1027.5\)</span> kg/m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span> at a depth of 500 decibars. If we use the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_t = 27.1\)</span> surface to estimate the slope between the two water
masses, we see that the surface changes from a depth of 350 m to a depth
of 650 m over a distance of 70 km. Therefore, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tan \gamma = 4300 \times 10^{-6} = 0.0043\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta v = v_2 - v_1 = -0.38\)</span> m/s. Assuming
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_2 = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_1 = 0.38\)</span> m/s. This rough estimate of the velocity of
the Gulf Stream compares well with velocity at a depth of 500m
calculated from hydrographic data (table 10.4) assuming a level of no
motion at 2,000 decibars.</p>
<p>The slope of the constant-density surfaces are clearly seen in figure
10.8. And plots of constant-density surfaces can be used to quickly
estimate current directions and a rough value for the speed. In
contrast, the slope of the sea surface is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8.4 \times 10^{-6}\)</span> or 0.84 m
in 100 km if we use data from table 10.4.</p>
<p>Note that constant-density surfaces in the Gulf Stream slope downward to
the east, and that sea-surface topography slopes upward to the east.
Constant pressure and constant density surfaces have opposite slope.</p>
<p>If the sharp interface between two water masses reaches the surface, it
is an oceanic front, which has properties that are very similar to
atmospheric fronts.</p>
<p>Eddies in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream can have warm or cold cores
(figure 10.12). Application of Margules’ method to these mesoscale
eddies gives the direction of the flow. Anticyclonic eddies (clockwise
rotation in the northern hemisphere) have warm cores (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_1\)</span> is deeper
in the center of the eddy than elsewhere) and the constant-pressure
surfaces bow upward. In particular, the sea surface is higher at the
center of the ring. Cyclonic eddies are the reverse.</p>

<p>Oceanography and fluid mechanics distinguish between two techniques for

follow a water particle. Eulerian techniques measure the velocity of
water at a fixed position.</p>
<section id="basic-technique">
<h3><span class="section-number">10.8.1. </span>Basic Technique<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-technique" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Lagrangian techniques track the position of a drifter designed to follow
a water parcel either on the surface or deeper within the water column.
The mean velocity over some period is calculated from the distance
between positions at the beginning and end of the period divided by the
period. Errors are due to:</p>
<p>The failure of the drifter to follow a parcel of water. We assume the
drifter stays in a parcel of water, but wind blowing on the surface
float of a surface drifter can cause the drifter to move relative to the
water.</p>
<p>Errors in determining the position of the drifter.</p>
<p>Sampling errors. Drifters go only where drifters want to go. And
drifters want to go to convergent zones. Hence drifters tend to avoid
areas of divergent flow.</p>

<p>Argos uses radio signals transmitted from surface buoys to determine the
position of the buoy. A satellite receives the signal from the buoy B.
The time rate of change of the signal, the Doppler shift <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>, is a
function of buoy position and distance from the satellite’s track. Note
that a buoy at BB would produce the same Doppler shift as the buoy at B.
The recorded Doppler signal is transmitted to ground stations E, which
relays the information to processing centers A via control stations K.

satellite to the buoy. The time of closest approach and the time rate of
change of Doppler frequency at that time gives the buoy’s position
relative to the orbit with a 180 ambiguity (B and BB in the figure).
Because the orbit is accurately known, and because the buoy can be

<p>The accuracy of the calculated position depends on the stability of the

on latitude. Because 1 cm/s <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\approx\)</span> 1 km/day, and because typical
values of currents in the ocean range from one to two hundred
centimeters per second, this is an very useful accuracy.</p>

<p>The most widely used, satellite-tracked drifter is the holey-sock
drifter. It consists of a cylindrical drogue of cloth 1 m in diameter by
15 m long with 14 large holes cut in the sides. The weight of the drogue

<p>The buoy was designed for the Surface Velocity Program and extensively
tested. Niiler et al. (1995) carefully measured the rate at which wind

<p>The most widely used subsurface floats are the Argo floats. The floats
(figure 10.14) are designed to cycle between the surface and some
predetermined depth. Most floats drift for 10 days at a depth of 1 km,
sink to 2 km, then rise to the surface. While rising, they profile
temperature and salinity as a function of pressure (depth). The floats
remains on the surface for a few hours, relays data to shore via the
Argos system, then sink again to 1 km. Each float carries enough power
to repeat this cycle for several years. The float thus measures currents
at 1 km depth and density distribution in the upper ocean. Three
thousand Argo floats are being deployed in all parts of the ocean for
the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment <span class="smallcaps">godae</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.8.5. </span>Lagrangian Measurements Using Tracers<a class="headerlink" href="#lagrangian-measurements-using-tracers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common method for measuring the flow in the deep ocean is to
track parcels of water containing molecules not normally found in the
ocean. Thanks to atomic bomb tests in the 1950s and the recent
exponential increase of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere, such
tracers have been introduced into the ocean in large quantities. See
§13.4 for a list of tracers used in oceanography. The distribution of
trace molecules is used to infer the movement of the water. The
technique is especially useful for calculating velocity of deep water
masses averaged over decades and for measuring turbulent mixing
discussed in §8.4.</p>
<p>Figure 10.15 Distribution of</p>
<p>tritium along a section through the western basins in the north
Atlantic, measured in 1972 (<strong>Top</strong>) and remeasured in 1981
(<strong>Bottom</strong>). Units are tritium units, where one tritium unit is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{18}\)</span> (tritium atoms)/(hydrogen atoms) corrected to the activity
levels that would have been observed on 1 January 1981. Compare this
figure to the density in the ocean shown in figure 13.10. After
Toggweiler (1994). <span id="fig:tritium" label="fig:tritium"></span></p>
<p>The distribution of trace molecules is calculated from the concentration
of the molecules in water samples collected on hydrographic sections and
surveys. Because the collection of data is expensive and slow, there are
few repeated sections. Figure 10.15 shows two maps of the distribution
of tritium in the north Atlantic collected in 1972–1973 by the Geosecs
Program and in 1981, a decade later. The sections show that tritium,
introduced into the atmosphere during the atomic bomb tests in the
atmosphere in the 1950s to 1972, penetrated to depths below 4 km only
north of 40N by 1971 and to 35N by 1981. This shows that deep currents
are very slow, about 1.6 mm/s in this example.</p>
<p>Because the deep currents are so small, we can question what process are
responsible for the observed distribution of tracers. Both turbulent
diffusion and advection by currents can fit the observations. Hence,
does figure 10.15 give mean currents in the deep Atlantic, or the
turbulent diffusion of tritium?</p>
<p>Figure 10.16 Ocean</p>
<p>temperature and current patterns are combined in this
<span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> analysis. Surface currents were computed by tracking
the displacement of small thermal or sediment features between a pair of
images. A directional edge-enhancement filter was applied here to define
better the different water masses. Warm water is shaded darker. From
Ocean Imaging, Solana Beach, California, with permission.
<span id="Fig10.16.bw" label="Fig10.16.bw"></span></p>
<p>Another useful tracer is the temperature and salinity of the water. I
will consider these observations in §13.4 where I describe the core
method for studying deep circulation. Here, I note that
<span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> observations of surface temperature of the ocean are
an additional source of information about currents.</p>
<p>Sequential infrared images of surface temperature are used to calculate
the displacement of features in the images (figure 10.16). The technique
is especially useful for surveying the variability of currents near
shore. Land provides reference points from which displacement can be
calculated accurately, and large temperature contrasts can be found in
many regions in some seasons.</p>
<p>There are two important limitations.</p>
<p>Many regions have extensive cloud cover, and the ocean cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Flow is primarily parallel to temperature fronts, and strong currents
can exist along fronts even though the front may not move. It is
therefore essential to track the motion of small eddies embedded in the
flow near the front and not the position of the front.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.8.6. </span>The Rubber Duckie Spill<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rubber-duckie-spill" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>On January 10, 1992 a 12.2-m container with 29,000 bathtub toys,
including rubber ducks (called rubber duckies by children) washed
overboard from a container ship at 44.7N, 178.1E (figure 10.17). Ten
months later the toys began washing ashore near Sitka, Alaska. A similar
accident on May 27, 1990 released 80,000 Nike-brand shoes at 48N, 161W
when waves washed containers from the <em>Hansa Carrier</em>.</p>
<p>The spills and eventual recovery of the toys and shoes proved to be good
tests of a numerical model for calculating the trajectories of oil
spills developed by Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham (1992, 1994). They
calculated the possible trajectories of the spilled toys using the Ocean
Surface Current Simulations <span class="smallcaps">oscurs</span> numerical model driven
by winds calculated from the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center’s daily
sea-level pressure data. After modifying their calculations by
increasing the windage coefficient by 50% for the toys and by decreasing
their angle of deflection function by 5, their calculations accurately
predicted the arrival of the toys near Sitka, Alaska on November 16,
1992, ten months after the spill.</p>

<p>Eulerian measurements are made by many different types of instruments on
ships and moorings.</p>
<p>Moorings (figure 10.18) are placed on the sea floor by ships. The
moorings may last for months to longer than a year. Because the mooring
must be deployed and recovered by deep-sea research ships, the technique
is expensive and few moorings are now being deployed. The subsurface
mooring shown on the right in the figure is preferred for several
reasons: it does not have a surface float that is forced by high
frequency, strong, surface currents; the mooring is out of sight and it
does not attract the attention of fishermen; and the flotation is
usually deep enough to avoid being caught by fishing nets. Measurements
made from moorings have errors due to:</p>
<p>Mooring motion. Subsurface moorings move least. Surface moorings in
strong currents move most, and are seldom used.</p>
<p>Inadequate Sampling. Moorings tend not to last long enough to give
accurate estimates of mean velocity or interannual variability of the
velocity.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">10.9.1. </span>Acoustic-Doppler Current Meters and Profilers<a class="headerlink" href="#acoustic-doppler-current-meters-and-profilers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common Eulerian measurements of currents are made using sound.
Typically, the current meter or profiler transmits sound in three or
four narrow beams pointed in different directions. Plankton and tiny
bubbles reflect the sound back to the instrument. The Doppler shift of
the reflected sound is proportional to the radial component of the
velocity of whatever reflects the sound. By combining data from three or
four beams, the horizontal velocity of the current is calculated
assuming the bubbles and plankton do not move very fast relative to the
water.</p>
<p>Two types of acoustic current meters are widely used. The
Acoustic-Doppler Current Profiler, called the <span class="smallcaps">adcp</span>,
measures the Doppler shift of sound reflected from water at various
distances from the instrument using sound beams projected into the water
just as a radar measures radio scatter as a function of range using
radio beams projected into the air. Data from the beams are combined to
give profiles of current velocity as a function of distance from the
instrument. On ships, the beams are pointed diagonally downward at 3–4
horizontal angles relative to the ship’s bow. Bottom-mounted meters use
beams pointed diagonally upward.</p>
<p>Ship-board instruments are widely used to profile currents within 200 to
300 m of the sea surface while the ship steams between hydrographic
stations. Because a ship moves relative to the bottom, the ship’s
velocity and orientation must be accurately known. <span class="smallcaps">gps</span>
data have provided this information since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Acoustic-Doppler current meters are much simpler than the
<span class="smallcaps">adcp</span>. They transmit continuous beams of sound to measure
current velocity close to the meter, not as a function of distance from
the meter. They are placed on moorings and sometimes on a
<span class="smallcaps">ctd</span>. Instruments on moorings record velocity as a function
of time for many days or months. The Aanderaa current meter (figure
10.19) in the figure is an example of this type. Instruments on
<span class="smallcaps">ctd</span>s profile currents from the surface to the bottom at
hydrographic stations.</p>

<li><p>Pressure distribution is almost precisely the hydrostatic pressure
obtained by assuming the ocean is at rest. Pressure is therefore
calculated very accurately from measurements of temperature and
conductivity as a function of pressure using the equation of state
of seawater. Hydrographic data give the relative, internal pressure
field of the ocean.</p>
<p>Flow in the ocean is in almost exact geostrophic balance except for
flow in the upper and lower boundary layers. Coriolis force almost
exactly balances the horizontal pressure gradient.</p>
<p>Satellite altimetric observations of the oceanic topography give the
surface geostrophic current. The calculation of topography requires
an accurate geoid. If the geoid is not known, altimeters can measure
the change in topography as a function of time, which gives the
change in surface geostrophic currents.</p>
<p>Topex/Poseidon and Jason are the most accurate altimeter systems,
and they can measure the topography or changes in topography with an
accuracy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->4 cm.</p>
<p>Hydrographic data are used to calculate the internal geostrophic
currents in the ocean relative to known currents at some level. The
level can be surface currents measured by altimetry or an assumed
level of no motion at depths below 1–2 km.</p>
<p>Flow in the ocean that is independent of depth is called barotropic
flow, flow that depends on depth is called baroclinic flow.
Hydrographic data give only the baroclinic flow.</p>
<p>Geostrophic flow cannot change with time, so the flow in the ocean
is not exactly geostrophic. The geostrophic method does not apply to
flows at the equator where the Coriolis force vanishes.</p>
<p>Slopes of constant density or temperature surfaces seen in a
cross-section of the ocean can be used to estimate the speed of flow
through the section.</p>
<p>Lagrangian techniques measure the position of a parcel of water in
the ocean. The position can be determined using surface drifters or
subsurface floats, or chemical tracers such as tritium.</p>
