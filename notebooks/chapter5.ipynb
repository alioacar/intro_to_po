    "About half the solar energy reaching earth is absorbed by the ocean and\n",
    "land, where it is temporarily stored near the surface. Only about a\n",
    "fifth of the available solar energy is directly absorbed by the\n",
    "atmosphere. Of the energy absorbed by the ocean, most is released\n",
    "locally to the atmosphere, mostly by evaporation and infrared radiation.\n",
    "The remainder is transported by currents to other areas especially mid\n",
    "latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat lost by the tropical ocean is the major source of heat needed to\n",

    "Changes in energy stored in the upper ocean result from an imbalance\n",
    "between input and output of heat through the sea surface. This transfer\n",
    "of heat across or through a surface is called a *heat flux*. The flux of\n",
    "heat and water also changes the density of surface waters, and hence\n",
    "their buoyancy. As a result, the sum of the heat and water fluxes is\n",
    "often called the *buoyancy flux*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux of energy to deeper layers is usually much smaller than the\n",
    "flux through the surface. And, the total flux of energy into and out of\n",
    "the ocean must be zero, otherwise the ocean as a whole would heat up or\n",
    "cool down. The sum of the heat fluxes into or out of a volume of water\n",
    "is the *heat budget*.\n",

    "## Heat-Budget Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the factors influencing each term in the heat budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Factors Influencing Insolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoming solar radiation is primarily determined by latitude, season,\n",
    "time of day, and cloudiness. The polar regions are heated less than the\n",
    "tropics, areas in winter are heated less than the same area in summer,\n",
    "areas in early morning are heated less than the same area at noon, and\n",
    "cloudy days have less sun than sunny days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following factors are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of the sun above the horizon, which depends on latitude,\n",
    "season, and time of day. Don’t forget, there is no insolation at night!\n",
    "The length of day, which depends on latitude and season. The\n",
    "cross-sectional area of the surface absorbing sunlight, which depends on\n",
    "height of the sun above the horizon. Attenuation, which depends on: i)\n",
    "Clouds, which absorb and scatter radiation. ii) Path length through the\n",
    "atmosphere, which varies as $\\csc \\varphi$, where $\\varphi$ is angle of\n",
    "the sun above the horizon. iii) Gas molecules which absorb radiation in\n",
    "some bands (figure 5.2). H$_2$O, O$_3$, and CO$_2$ are all important.\n",
    "iv) Aerosols which scatter and absorb radiation. Both volcanic and\n",
    "marine aerosols are important. And v) dust, which scatters radiation,\n",
    "especially Saharan dust over the Atlantic. Reflectivity of the surface,\n",
    "which depends on solar elevation angle and roughness of sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar inclination and cloudiness dominate. Absorption by ozone, water\n",
    "vapor, aerosols, and dust are much weaker.\n",

    "##### Factors Influencing Infrared Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The sea surface radiates as a blackbody having the same temperature as\n",
    "the water, which is roughly 290 K. The distribution of radiation as a\n",
    "function of wavelength is given by Planck’s equation. Sea water at 290 K\n",

    "it modulates $Q_{LW}$, which is a maximum at these wavelengths. After\n",
    "Selby and McClatchey (1975). <span id=\"fig:transmittance\" label=\"fig:transmittance\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmittance on a cloud-free day through the window from 8 $\\mu$m\n",
    "to 13 $\\mu$m is determined mostly by water vapor. Absorption in other\n",
    "bands, such as those at 3.5 $\\mu$m to 4.0 $\\mu$m depends on CO$_2$\n",
    "concentration in the atmosphere. As the concentration of CO$_2$\n",
    "increases, these windows close and more radiation is trapped by the\n",
    "atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the atmosphere is mostly transparent to incoming sunlight, and\n",
    "somewhat opaque to outgoing infrared radiation, the atmosphere traps\n",
    "radiation. The trapped radiation, coupled with convection in the\n",
    "atmosphere, keeps earth’s surface 33 warmer than it would be in the\n",
    "absence of a convecting, wet atmosphere but in thermal equilibrium with\n",
    "space. The atmosphere acts like the panes of glass on a greenhouse, and\n",
    "the effect is known as the *greenhouse effect*. See Hartmann (1994:\n",
    "24–26) for a simple discussion of the radiative balance of a planet.\n",
    "CO$_2$, water vapor, methane, and ozone are all important greenhouse\n",
    "gasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net infrared flux depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds thickness. The thicker the cloud deck, the less heat escapes to\n",
    "space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud height, which determines the temperature at which the cloud\n",
    "radiates heat back to the ocean. The rate is proportional to $t^4$,\n",
    "where $t$ is the temperature of the radiating body in Kelvins. High\n",
    "clouds are colder than low clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Atmospheric water-vapor content. The more humid the atmosphere the less\n",
    "heat escapes to space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water Temperature. The hotter the water the more heat is radiated.\n",
    "Again, radiation depends of $t^4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ice and snow cover. Ice emits as a black body, but it cools much faster\n",
    "than open water. Ice-covered seas are insulated from the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water vapor and clouds influence the net loss of infrared radiation more\n",
    "than surface temperature. Hot tropical regions lose less heat than cold\n",
    "polar regions. The temperature range from poles to equator is\n",
    "$0^{\\circ}\\rm{C} < t < 25^{\\circ}\\rm{C}$ or $273\\rm{K} < t < 298\\rm{K}$, and the ratio of maximum to minimum temperature in Kelvins\n",
    "is 298/273 = 1.092. Raised to the fourth power this is 1.42. Thus there\n",
    "is a 42% increase in emitted radiation from pole to equator. Over the\n",
    "same distance water vapor can change the net emitted radiance by 200%.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Factors Influencing Latent-Heat Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent heat flux is influenced primarily by wind speed and relative\n",
    "humidity. High winds and dry air evaporate much more water than weak\n",
    "winds with relative humidity near 100%. In polar regions, evaporation\n",
    "from ice covered ocean is much less than from open water. In the arctic,\n",
    "most of the heat lost from the sea is through leads (ice-free areas).\n",
    "Hence the percent open water is very important for the arctic heat\n",

    "$$-130 \\text{\\ W/m$^2$} < Q_{L} < -10 \\text{\\ W/m$^2$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Factors Influencing Sensible-Heat Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensible heat flux is influenced by wind speed and air-sea temperature\n",
    "difference. High winds and large temperature differences cause high\n",
    "fluxes. Think of this as a wind-chill factor for the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average annual value for sensible-heat flux is in the range:\n",
    "$$-42 \\text{\\ W/m$^2$} < Q_{S} < -2 \\text{\\ W/m$^2$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direct Calculation of Fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can describe the geographical distribution of fluxes into and\n",
    "out of the ocean, we need to know how they are measured or calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gust-Probe Measurements of Turbulent Fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one accurate method for calculating fluxes of sensible and\n",
    "latent heat and momentum at the sea surface: from direct measurement of\n",
    "turbulent quantities in the atmospheric boundary layer made by gust\n",

    "measurements have been made. They are expensive, and they cannot be used\n",
    "to calculate heat fluxes averaged over many days or large areas. The\n",
    "gust-probe measurements are used only to calibrate other methods of\n",
    "calculating fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements must be made in the surface layer of the atmospheric\n",
    "boundary layer (See §4.3), usually within 30 m of the sea surface,\n",
    "because fluxes are independent of height in this layer. Measurements\n",
    "must be made by fast-response instruments (gust probes) able to make\n",
    "several observations per second on a tower, or every meter from a plane.\n",
    "Measurements include the horizontal and vertical components of the wind,\n",

    "##### Wind Speed and Stress\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress is calculated from wind observations made from ships at sea and\n",
    "from scatterometers in space as described in the last chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Insolation\n",
    "\n",
    "is calculated from cloud observations made from ships and from\n",
    "visible-light radiometers on meteorological satellites. Satellite\n",
    "measurements are far more accurate than the ship data because it’s very\n",
    "hard to measure cloudiness from below the clouds. Satellite measurements\n",
    "processed by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">isccp</span> are the basis for maps of insolation and its\n",
    "variability from month to month (Darnell et al. 1988; Rossow and\n",
    "Schiffer 1991).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind the calculation of insolation is this. Sunlight at\n",
    "the top of the atmosphere is accurately known from the solar constant,\n",
    "latitude, longitude, and time. Sunlight is either reflected back to\n",
    "space by clouds, or it eventually reaches the sea surface. Only a small\n",
    "and nearly constant fraction is absorbed in the atmosphere. But, recent\n",
    "work by Cess et al. (1995) and Ramanathan et al. (1995) suggest that\n",
    "this basic idea may be incomplete, and that atmospheric absorption may\n",
    "be a function of cloudiness. Assuming atmospheric absorption is\n",
    "constant, insolation is calculated from:\n",
    "$$\\text{Insolation} = S (1 - A) - C$$ where $S = 1365$ W/m$^2$ is the\n",
    "solar constant, $A$ is albedo, the ratio of incident to reflected\n",
    "sunlight, and $C$ is a constant which includes absorption by ozone and\n",
    "other atmospheric gases and by cloud droplets. Insolation is calculated\n",
    "from cloud data (which also includes reflection from aerosols) collected\n",
    "from instruments such as the <span class=\"smallcaps\">avhrr</span> on meteorological\n",
    "satellites. Ozone and gas absorption are calculated from known\n",
    "distributions of the gases in the atmosphere. Q$_{SW}$ is calculated\n",
    "from satellite data with an accuracy of 5–7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water Flux In (Rainfall)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rain rate is another variable that is very difficult to measure from\n",
    "ships. Rain collected from gauges at different locations on ships and\n",
    "from gauges on nearby docks all differ by more than a factor of two.\n",
    "Rain at sea falls mostly horizontally because of wind, and the ship’s\n",
    "superstructure distorts the paths of raindrops. Rain in many areas falls\n",
    "mostly as drizzle, and it is difficult to detect and measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate measurements of rain rate in the tropics ($\\pm 35$)\n",
    "are calculated from microwave radiometers and radar observations of rain\n",
    "at several frequencies using instruments on the Tropical Rain Measuring\n",
    "Mission <span class=\"smallcaps\">trmm</span> launched in 1997. Rain for other times and\n",
    "latitudes can be calculated accurately by combining microwave data with\n",
    "infrared observations of the height of cloud tops and with rain gauge\n",
    "data (figure 5.5). Rain is also calculated from the reanalyses weather\n",
    "data by numerical models of the atmospheric circulation (Schubert, Rood,\n",
    "and Pfaendtner, 1993), and by combining ship and satellite observations\n",
    "with analyses from numerical weather-prediction models (Xie and Arkin,\n",
    "1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest source of error is due to conversion of rain rate to\n",
    "cumulative rainfall, a sampling error. Rain is very rare, it is\n",
    "log-normally distributed, and most rain comes from a few storms.\n",
    "Satellites tend to miss storms, and data must be averaged over areas up\n",
    "to 5 on a side to obtain useful values of rainfall.\n",

    "##### Net Long-Wave Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Net Long-wave radiation is not easily calculated because it depends on\n",
    "the height and thickness of clouds, and the vertical distribution of\n",
    "water vapor in the atmosphere. It is calculated by numerical\n",
    "weather-prediction models or from observations of the vertical structure\n",
    "of the atmosphere from atmospheric sounders.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Water Flux Out (Latent Heat Flux)\n",
    "\n",
    "Latent heat flux is calculated from ship observations of relative\n",
    "humidity, water temperature, and wind speed using bulk formulas (5.10c)\n",
    "and ship data accumulated in the <span class=\"smallcaps\">icoads</span> described below.\n",
    "The fluxes are not calculated from satellite data because satellite\n",
    "instruments are not very sensitive to water vapor close to the sea.\n",
    "Perhaps the best fluxes are those calculated from numerical weather\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sensible Heat Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensible heat flux is calculated from observations of air-sea\n",
    "temperature difference and wind speed made from ships, or by numerical\n",
    "weather models. Sensible fluxes are small almost everywhere except\n",
    "offshore of the east coasts of continents in winter when cold, Arctic\n",
    "air masses extract heat from warm, western, boundary currents. In these\n",
    "areas, numerical models give perhaps the best values of the fluxes.\n",
    "Historical ship report give the long-term mean values of the fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Data Sets for Fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ship and satellite data have been processed to produce global maps of\n",
    "fluxes. Ship measurements made over the past 150 years yield maps of the\n",
    "long-term mean values of the fluxes, especially in the northern\n",
    "hemisphere. Ship data, however, are sparse in time and space, and they\n",
    "are being replaced more and more by fluxes calculated by numerical\n",
    "weather models and by satellite data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful maps are those made by combining level 3 and 4 satellite\n",
    "data sets with observations from ships, using numerical weather models.\n",

    "Heat fluxes from the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ncep</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span>\n",

    "calculated directly from ship observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation of boundary-layer clouds is a significant source of error\n",
    "in calculated fluxes. The poor vertical resolution of the numerical\n",
    "models does not adequately resolve the low-level cloud structure\n",

    "\n",
    "The fluxes have zonal means that differ significantly from the same\n",

    "can exceed 40 W/m$^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmospheric models do not require that the net heat flux averaged\n",
    "over time and earth’s surface be zero. The <span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> data set\n",
    "averaged over fifteen years gives a net flux of 3.7 W/m$^2$ into the\n",
    "ocean. The <span class=\"smallcaps\">ncep</span> reanalysis gives a net flux of 5.8 W/m$^2$\n",
    "out of the ocean (Taylor, 2000: 206). <span class=\"smallcaps\">Icoads</span> data give a\n",
    "net flux of 16 W/m$^2$ into the ocean (figure 5.7).\n",

    "## Meridional Heat Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, earth gains heat at the top of the tropical atmosphere, and it\n",
    "loses heat at the top of the polar atmosphere. The atmospheric and\n",
    "oceanic circulation together must transport heat from low to high\n",
    "latitudes to balance the gains and losses. This north-south transport is\n",
    "called the *meridional heat transport*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the meridional heat transport in the ocean and atmosphere is\n",
    "calculated from the zonal average of the net heat flux through the top\n",
    "of the atmosphere measured by satellites. In making the calculation, we\n",
    "assume that transports averaged over a few years are steady. Thus any\n",
    "long-term, net heat gain or loss through the top of the atmosphere must\n",
    "be balanced by a meridional transport and not by heat storage in the\n",
    "ocean or atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Net Heat Flux at the Top of the Atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Heat flux through the top of the atmosphere is measured very accurately\n",
    "by radiometers on satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insolation is calculated from the solar constant and observations of\n",
    "reflected sunlight made by meteorological satellites and by special\n",
    "satellites of the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrared radiation is measured by infrared radiometers on the\n",
    "satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between insolation and net infrared radiation is the net\n",
    "heat flux across the top of the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Net Meridional Heat Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the meridional heat transport in the atmosphere and the\n",
    "ocean, we first average the net heat flux through the top of the\n",
    "atmosphere in a zonal band. Because the meridional derivative of the\n",
    "transport is the zonal-mean flux, we calculate the transport from the\n",
    "meridional integral of the zonal-mean flux. The integral must be\n",
    "balanced by the heat transported by the atmosphere and the ocean across\n",
    "each latitude band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations by Trenberth and Caron (2001) show that the total,\n",
    "annual-mean, meridional heat transport by the ocean and atmosphere peaks\n",
    "at 6 PW toward each pole at 35 latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Oceanic Heat Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "The meridional heat transport in the ocean can be calculated three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Surface Flux Method* calculates the heat flux through the sea surface\n",
    "from measurements of wind, insolation, air, and sea temperature, and\n",
    "cloudiness. The fluxes are integrated to obtain the zonal average of the\n",
    "heat flux (figure 5.7). Finally, we calculate the transport from the\n",
    "meridional integral of the zonal-mean flux just as we did at the top of\n",
    "the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Direct Method* calculates the heat transport from values of current\n",
    "velocity and temperature measured from top to bottom along a zonal\n",
    "section spanning an ocean basin. The flux is the product of northward\n",
    "velocity and heat content derived from the temperature measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Residual Method* first calculates the atmospheric heat transport from\n",
    "atmospheric measurements or the output of numerical weather models. This\n",
    "is the direct method applied to the atmosphere. The atmospheric\n",
    "transport is subtracted from the total meridional transport calculated\n",
    "from the top-of-the-atmosphere heat flux to obtain the oceanic\n",
    "contribution as a residual (figure 5.11).\n",

    "figure are realistic. The total meridional transport of heat by the\n",
    "ocean is small compared with the total meridional heat transport by the\n",
    "atmosphere except in the tropics. At 35, where the total meridional heat\n",
    "transport is greatest, the ocean carries only 22% of the heat in the\n",
    "northern hemisphere, and 8% in the southern (Trenberth and Caron, 2001).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations in Solar Constant\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assumed so far that the solar constant, the output of light and\n",
    "heat from the sun, is steady. Recent evidence based on variability of\n",
    "sunspots and faculae (bright spots) shows that the output varied by\n",
    "$\\pm 0.2$% over centuries (Lean, Beer, and Bradley, 1995), and that this\n",
    "variability is correlated with changes in global mean temperature of\n",
    "earth’s surface of $\\pm 0.4$. (figure 5.12). In addition, White and\n",
    "Cayan (1998) found a small 12 yr, 22 yr, and longer-period variations of\n",
    "sea-surface temperature measured by bathythermographs and ship-board\n",
    "thermometers over the past century. The observed response of earth to\n",
    "solar variability is about that calculated from numerical models of the\n",
    "coupled ocean-atmosphere climate system. Many other changes in climate\n",
    "and weather have been attributed to solar variability. The correlations\n",
    "are somewhat controversial, and much more information can be found in\n",
    "Hoyt and Schatten’s (1997) book on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Sunlight is absorbed primarily in the tropical ocean. The amount of\n",
    "    sunlight changes with season, latitude, time of day, and cloud\n",
    "    cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Most of the heat absorbed by the ocean in the tropics is released as\n",
    "    water vapor which heats the atmosphere when water is condenses as\n",
    "    rain. Most of the rain falls in the tropical convergence zones,\n",
    "    lesser amounts fall in mid-latitudes near the polar front.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Heat released by rain and absorbed infrared radiation from the ocean\n",
    "    are the primary drivers for the atmospheric circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The net heat flux from the ocean is largest in mid-latitudes and\n",
    "    offshore of Japan and New England.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Heat fluxes can be measured directly using fast response instruments\n",
    "    on low-flying aircraft, but this is not useful for measuring heat\n",
    "    fluxes over large oceanic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Heat fluxes through large regions of the sea surface can be\n",
    "    calculated from bulk formula. Seasonal, regional, and global maps of\n",
    "    fluxes are available based on ship and satellite observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most widely used data sets for studying heat fluxes are the\n",
    "    International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set and the\n",
    "    reanalysis of meteorological data by numerical weather prediction\n",
    "    models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The atmosphere transports most of the heat needed to warm latitudes\n",
    "    higher than 35. The oceanic meridional transport is comparable to\n",
    "    the atmospheric meridional transport only in the tropics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Solar output is not constant, and the observed small variations in\n",
    "    output of heat and light from the sun seem to produce the changes in\n",
