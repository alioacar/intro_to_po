    "further transferring the change in momentum into the interior of the\n",
    "fluid. This transfer of momentum is *molecular viscosity*. Molecules,\n",
    "however, travel only micrometers between collisions, and the process is\n",

    "\n",
    "The Reynolds stresses such as\n",

    "(cf. Goldstein, 1965: §69 & §81) because we assume that they play the\n",

    "##### From Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate Reynolds stresses from direct measurements of\n",
    "($u', v', w'$) made in the laboratory or ocean. This is accurate, but\n",
    "hard to generalize to other flows. So we seek more general approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### By Analogy with Molecular Viscosity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s return to the example in figure 8.1, which shows flow above a\n",
    "surface in the $x$, $y$ plane. Prandtl, in a revolutionary paper\n",
    "published in 1904, stated that turbulent viscous effects are only\n",
    "important in a very thin layer close to the surface, the boundary layer.\n",
    "Prandtl’s invention of the boundary layer allows us to describe very\n",
    "accurately turbulent flow of wind above the sea surface, or flow at the\n",
    "bottom boundary layer in the ocean, or flow in the mixed layer at the\n",
    "sea surface. See the box *Turbulent Boundary Layer Over a Flat Plate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate flow in a boundary layer, we assume that flow is constant\n",
    "in the $x$, $y$ direction, that the statistical properties of the flow\n",
    "vary only in the $z$ direction, and that the mean flow is steady.\n",
    "Therefore $\\partial /\\partial t = \\partial /\\partial x = \\partial /\\partial y = 0$, and (8.10) can be written:\n",
    "$$2 \\Omega V \\sin \\varphi + \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z} \\left[\\nu \\frac{\\partial\n",

    "$$- \\rho \\langle u'w'\\rangle = T_{xz} = \\rho A_z \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Because eddies can mix heat, salt, or other properties as well as\n",

    "is no general solution, but the approach leads to useful understanding\n",
    "of some forms of turbulence such as isotropic turbulence downstream of a\n",

    "turbulence with statistical properties that are independent of\n",

    "The approach can be modified somewhat for flow in the ocean. In the\n",

    "properties of a flow in thermodynamic equilibrium. Because the actual\n",
    "flow in the ocean is far from equilibrium, we assume it will evolve\n",
    "towards equilibrium. Holloway (1986) provides a good review of this\n",

    "\n",
    "Turbulence in the ocean leads to mixing. Because the ocean has stable\n",
    "stratification, vertical displacement must work against the buoyancy\n",
    "force. Vertical mixing requires more energy than horizontal mixing. As a\n",
    "result, horizontal mixing along surfaces of constant density is much\n",
    "larger than vertical mixing across surfaces of constant density. The\n",
    "latter, however, usually called *diapycnal mixing*, is very important\n",

    "to a large extent the rate at which deep water eventually reaches the\n",

    "over decades (figure 8.4). This was a remarkable observation because we\n",
    "expect downward mixing would continuously deepen the thermocline. But it\n",
    "doesn’t. Therefore, a steady-state thermocline requires that the\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens. Heat diffuses across the interface faster than\n",

    "layer below, and the water in the layer sinks. Because the layer is\n",
    "thin, the fluid sinks in fingers 1–5 cm in diameter and 10s of\n",

    "This is *salt fingering*. Because two constituents diffuse across the\n",

    "There are four variations on this theme. Two variables taken two at a\n",

    "*Warm salty over colder less salty*. This process is called *salt\n",
    "fingering*. It occurs in the thermocline below the surface waters of\n",

    "North-east Atlantic beneath the outflow from the Mediterranean Sea. Salt\n",
    "fingering eventually leads to density increasing with depth in a series\n",
    "of steps. Layers of constant-density are separated by thin layers with\n",
    "large changes in density, and the profile of density as a function of\n",
    "depth looks like stair steps. Schmitt et al (1987) observed 5–30 m\n",

    "*Colder less salty over warm salty*. This process is called *diffusive\n",

    "mostly found at high latitudes. Diffusive convection also leads to a\n",
    "stair step of density as a function of depth. Here’s what happens in\n",
    "this case. Double diffusion leads to a thin, warm, less-salty layer at\n",
    "the base of the upper, colder, less-salty layer. The thin layer of water\n",
    "rises and mixes with water in the upper layer. A similar processes\n",

    "interface. As a result of the convection in the upper and lower layers,\n",
    "the interface is sharpened. Any small gradients of density in either\n",
