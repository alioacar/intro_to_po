<p>Our knowledge of oceanic currents, winds, waves, and tides goes back
thousands of years. Polynesian navigators traded over long distances
in the Pacific as early as 4000 BC <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id11" title="R. F. Service. Rock chemistry traces ancient traders. Science, 274(5295):2012–2013, 1996.">10</a>]</span>. Pytheas
explored the Atlantic from Italy to Norway in 325 BC. Arabic
traders used their knowledge of the reversing winds and currents in
the Indian Ocean to establish trade routes to China in the Middle Ages
and later to Zanzibar on the African coast. And, the connection
between tides and the sun and moon was
described in the Samaveda of the Indian Vedic period extending from
2000 to 1400 BC <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id12" title="D. T. Pugh. Tides, Surges, and Mean Sea-Level. John Wiley, Chichester, 1987.">11</a>]</span>.  Those oceanographers who tend
to accept as true only that which has been measured by instruments,
have much to learn from those who earned their living on the ocean.</p>
<p>Modern European knowledge of the ocean began with voyages of discovery
by Bartholomew Dias (1487–1488), Christopher Columbus (1492–1494),
Vasco da Gama (1497–1499), Ferdinand Magellan (1519–1522), and many
others. They laid the foundation for global trade routes stretching
from Spain to the Philippines in the early 16th century. The routes
were based on a good working knowledge of trade winds, the westerlies,
and western boundary currents in the Atlantic and Pacific <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id13" title="A. Couper, editor. The Times Atlas of the Oceans. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, 1983.">12</a>]</span>: 192–193.</p>
<p>The early European explorers were soon followed by scientific voyages
of discovery led by (among many others) James Cook (1728–1779) on the
<em>Endeavour</em>, <em>Resolution</em>, and <em>Adventure</em>,
Charles Darwin (1809–1882) on the <em>Beagle</em>, Sir James Clark
Ross and Sir John Ross who surveyed the Arctic and Antarctic regions
from the <em>Victory</em>, the <em>Isabella</em>, and the
<em>Erebus</em>, and Edward Forbes (1815–1854) who studied the
vertical distribution of life in the ocean. Others collected oceanic
observations and produced useful charts, including Edmond Halley who
charted the trade winds and monsoons and Benjamin Franklin who charted
the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>Slow ships of the 19th and 20th centuries gave way to satellites,
drifters, and autonomous instruments toward the end of the 20th
century. Satellites now observe the ocean, air, and land. Thousands of
drifters observe the upper two kilometers of the ocean. Data from
these systems, when fed into numerical models allows the study of
earth as a system.  For the first time, we can study how biological,
chemical, and physical systems interact to influence our environment.</p>

<p>The long history of the study of the ocean has led to the development
of various, specialized disciplines each with its own interests and
vocabulary. The more important disciplines include:</p>
<p><em>Oceanography</em> is the study of the
ocean, with emphasis on its character as an environment. The goal is
to obtain a description sufficiently quantitative to be used for
predicting the future with some certainty.</p>
<p><em>Geophysics</em> is the study of the
physics of the earth.</p>
<p><em>Physical Oceanography</em> is the
study of physical properties and dynamics of
the ocean. The primary interests are the interaction of the ocean with
the atmosphere, the oceanic heat budget, water mass formation,
currents, and coastal dynamics. Physical Oceanography is considered by
many to be a subdiscipline of geophysics.</p>
<p><em>Geophysical Fluid Dynamics</em> is
the study of the dynamics of
fluid motion on scales influenced by the rotation of the
earth. Meteorology and oceanography use geophysical fluid dynamics to
calculate planetary flow fields.</p>
<p><em>Hydrography</em> is the preparation of
nautical charts, including charts of ocean depths, currents, internal
density field of the ocean, and tides.</p>
<p><em>Earth-system Science</em> is the study of earth as a single
system comprising many interacting subsystems including the ocean,
atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere, and changes in these systems
due to human activity.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Milestones in the Understanding of the Ocean<a class="headerlink" href="#milestones-in-the-understanding-of-the-ocean" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>What have all these programs and expeditions taught us about the ocean?
Let’s look at some milestones in our ever increasing understanding of
the ocean beginning with the first scientific investigations of the 17th
century. Initially progress was slow. First came very simple
observations of far reaching importance by scientists who probably did
not consider themselves oceanographers, if the term even existed. Later
came more detailed descriptions and oceanographic experiments by
scientists who specialized in the study of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>1685</strong> - Edmond Halley, investigating the oceanic wind systems and currents,
published “An Historical Account of the Trade Winds, and Monsoons,
observable in the Seas between and near the Tropicks, with an
attempt to assign the Physical cause of the said Winds”
<em>Philosophical Transactions</em>.</p>
<p><strong>1735</strong> - George Hadley published his theory for the trade winds based on
conservation of angular momentum in “Concerning the Cause of the
General Trade-Winds” <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, 39: 58-62.</p>
<p><strong>1751</strong> - Henri Ellis made the first deep soundings of temperature in the
tropics, finding cold water below a warm surface layer, indicating
the water came from the polar regions.</p>
<p><strong>1769</strong> - Benjamin Franklin, as postmaster, made the first map of the Gulf
Stream using information from mail ships sailing between New England
and England collected by his cousin Timothy Folger (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig2-7"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2.7</span></a>).</p>

<p><strong>1775</strong> - Laplace’s published his theory of tides.</p>
<p><strong>1800</strong> - Count Rumford proposed a meridional circulation of the ocean with
water sinking near the poles and rising near the Equator.</p>
<p><strong>1847</strong> - Matthew Fontaine Maury published his first chart of winds and
currents based on ships logs. Maury established the practice of
international exchange of environmental data, trading logbooks for
maps and charts derived from the data.</p>
<p><strong>1872–1876</strong> - Challenger Expedition marks the beginning of the systematic study of
the biology, chemistry, and physics of the ocean of the world.</p>
<p><strong>1885</strong> - Pillsbury made direct measurements of the Florida Current using
current meters deployed from a ship moored in the stream.</p>
<p><strong>1903</strong> - Founding of the Marine Biological Laboratory of the University of
California. It later became the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p><strong>1910–1913</strong> - Vilhelm Bjerknes published <em>Dynamic Meteorology and Hydrography</em>
which laid the foundation of geophysical fluid dynamics. In it he
developed the idea of fronts, the dynamic meter, geostrophic flow,
air-sea interaction, and cyclones.</p>
<p><strong>1930</strong> - Founding of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p>
<p><strong>1942</strong> - Publication of <em>The ocean</em> by Sverdrup, Johnson, and Fleming, a
comprehensive survey of oceanographic knowledge up to that time.</p>
<p><strong>Post WW 2</strong> - The need to detect submarines led the navies of the world to greatly
expand their studies of the sea. This led to the founding of
oceanography departments at state universities, including Oregon
State, Texas A&amp;M University, University of Miami, and University of
Rhode Island, and the founding of national ocean laboratories such
as the various Institutes of Oceanographic Science.</p>
<p><strong>1947–1950</strong> - Sverdrup, Stommel, and Munk publish their theories of the
wind-driven circulation of the ocean. Together the three papers lay
the foundation for our understanding of the ocean’s circulation.</p>

California Current. The most complete study ever undertaken of a
coastal current.</p>
<p><strong>1952</strong> - Cromwell and Montgomery rediscover the Equatorial Undercurrent in
the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>1955</strong> - Bruce Hamon and Neil Brown develop the CTD for measuring
conductivity and temperature as a function of depth in the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>1958</strong> - Stommel publishes his theory for the deep circulation of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>1963</strong> - Sippican Corporation (Tim Francis, William Van Allen Clark, Graham
Campbell, and Sam Francis) invents the Expendable BathyThermograph

Seasat. The project developed techniques used by generations of
remotes sensing satellites.</p>
<p><strong>1979–1981</strong> - Terry Joyce, Rob Pinkel, Lloyd Regier, F. Rowe and J. W. Young
develop techniques leading to the acoustic-doppler current profiler
for measuring ocean-surface currents from moving ships, an
instrument widely used in oceanography.</p>
<p><strong>1988</strong> - <span class="smallcaps">nasa</span> Earth System Science Committee headed by Francis
Bretherton outlines how all earth systems are interconnected, thus
breaking down the barriers separating traditional sciences of
astrophysics, ecology, geology, meteorology, and oceanography.</p>
<p><strong>1991</strong> - Wally Broecker proposes that changes in the deep circulation of the
ocean modulate the ice ages, and that the deep circulation in the
Atlantic could collapse, plunging the northern hemisphere into a new
ice age.</p>
<p><strong>1992</strong> - Russ Davis and Doug Webb invent the autonomous, pop-up drifter that
continuously measures currents at depths to 2 km.</p>

<p>Data collected from the centuries of oceanic expeditions have been used
to describe the ocean. Most of the work went toward describing the
steady state of the ocean, its currents from top to bottom, and its
interaction with the atmosphere. The basic description was mostly
complete by the early 1970s. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig2-8"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2.8</span></a> shows an example from that time,

<section id="the-role-of-observations-in-oceanography">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.5. </span>The Role of Observations in Oceanography<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-observations-in-oceanography" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The brief tour of theoretical ideas suggests that observations are
essential for understanding the ocean. The theory describing a
convecting, wind-forced, turbulent fluid in a rotating coordinate system
has never been sufficiently well known that important features of the
oceanic circulation could be predicted before they were observed. In
almost all cases, oceanographers resort to observations to understand
oceanic processes.</p>
<p>At first glance, we might think that the numerous expeditions mounted
since 1873 would give a good description of the ocean. The results are
indeed impressive. Hundreds of expeditions have extended into all ocean.
Yet, much of the ocean is poorly explored.</p>
<p>By the year 2000, most areas of the ocean will have been sampled from
top to bottom only once. Some areas, such as the Atlantic, will have
been sparsely sampled three times: during the International Geophysical
Year in 1959, during the Geochemical Sections cruises in the early
1970s, and during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment from 1991 to
1996. All areas will be vastly under sampled. This is the sampling
problem (<a class="reference internal" href="#sampling-error"><span class="std std-ref">Sampling Error</span></a>). Our samples of the ocean are
insufficient to describe the ocean well enough to predict its
variability and its response to changing forcing. <em>Lack of sufficient
samples is the largest source of error in our understanding of the
ocean.</em></p>
<p>The lack of observations has led to a very important and widespread
conceptual error:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>“The absence of evidence was taken as evidence of absence.”</em> The
great difficulty of observing the ocean meant that when a phenomenon
was not observed, it was assumed it was not present. The more one is
able to observe the ocean, the more the complexity and subtlety that
appears - Wunsch, 2002 <span id="id13">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id19" title="C. Wunsch. Ocean observations and the climate forecast problem. In R. P. Pearce, editor, Meteorology at the Millennium, pages 233–245. Royal Meteorological Society, London, 2002.">18</a>]</span>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As a result, our understanding of the ocean is often too simple to be
correct.</p>
<section id="selecting-oceanic-data-sets">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.5.1. </span>Selecting Oceanic Data Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-oceanic-data-sets" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Much of the existing oceanic data have been organized into large data
sets. For example, satellite data are processed and distributed by
groups working with <span class="small">NASA</span>. Data from ships have been
collected and organized by other groups. Oceanographers now rely more
and more on such collections of data produced by others.</p>
<p>The use of data produced by others introduces problems: i) How accurate
are the data in the set? ii) What are the limitations of the data set?
And, iii) How does the set compare with other similar sets? Anyone who
uses public or private data sets is wise to obtain answers to such
questions.</p>
<p>If you plan to use data from others, here are some guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Use well documented data sets</em>. Does the documentation completely
describe the sources of the original measurements, all steps used to
process the data, and all criteria used to exclude data? Does the data
set include version numbers to identify changes to the set?</p>
<p><em>Use validated data</em>. Has accuracy of data been well documented? Was
accuracy determined by comparing with different measurements of the same
variable? Was validation global or regional?</p>
<p><em>Use sets that have been used by others and referenced in scientific
papers</em>. Some data sets are widely used for good reason. Those who
produced the sets used them in their own published work and others trust
the data.</p>
<p><em>Conversely, don’t use a data set just because it is handy</em>. Can you
document the source of the set? For example, many versions of the
digital, 5-minute maps of the sea floor are widely available. Some date
back to the first sets produced by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency,
others are from the <span class="small">ETOPO-5</span> set. Don’t rely on a
colleague’s statement about the source. Find the documentation. If it is
missing, find another data set.</p>

<section id="designing-oceanic-experiments">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.5.2. </span>Designing Oceanic Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-oceanic-experiments" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Observations are exceedingly important for oceanography, yet
observations are expensive because ship time and satellites are
expensive. As a result, oceanographic experiments must be carefully
planned. While the design of experiments may not fit well within an
historical chapter, perhaps the topic merits a few brief comments
because it is seldom mentioned in oceanographic textbooks, although it
is prominently described in texts for other scientific fields. The
design of experiments is particularly important because poorly planned
experiments lead to ambiguous results, they may measure the wrong
variables, or they may produce completely useless data.</p>
<div class="tip admonition" id="sampling-error">
<p class="admonition-title">Sampling Error</p>
<p>Sampling error is the largest source of error in the geosciences. It
is caused by a set of samples not representing the population of the
variable being measured. A population is the set of all possible
measurements, and a sample is the sampled subset of the population. We
assume each measurement is perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>To determine if your measurement has a sampling error,
you must first completely specify the problem you wish to study. This
defines the population. Then, you must determine if the samples
represent the population.  Both steps are necessary.</p>
<p>Suppose your problem is to measure the annual-mean
sea-surface temperature of the ocean to determine if global warming is
occurring. For this problem, the population is the set of all possible
measurements of surface temperature, in all regions in all months. If
the sample mean is to equal the true mean, the samples must be
uniformly distributed throughout the year and over all the area of the
ocean, and sufficiently dense to include all important variability in
time and space. This is impossible. Ships avoid stormy regions such as
high latitudes in winter, so ship samples tend not to represent the
population of surface temperatures. Satellites may not sample
uniformly throughout the daily cycle, and they may not observe
temperature at high latitudes in winter because of persistent clouds,
although they tend to sample uniformly in space and throughout the
year in most regions. If daily variability is small, the satellite
samples will be more representative of the population than the ship
samples.</p>
<p>From the above, it should be clear that oceanic samples
rarely represent the population we wish to study. We always have
sampling errors.</p>
<p>In defining sampling error, we must clearly distinguish
between instrument errors and sampling errors. Instrument errors are
due to the inaccuracy of the instrument. Sampling errors are due to a
failure to make a measurement. Consider the example above: the
determination of mean sea-surface temperature. If the measurements are
made by thermometers on ships, each measurement has a small error
because thermometers are not perfect. This is an instrument error. If
the ships avoids high latitudes in winter, the absence of measurements
at high latitude in winter is a sampling error.</p>
<p>Meteorologists designing the Tropical Rainfall Mapping
Mission have been investigating the sampling error in measurements of
rain. Their results are general and may be applied to other
variables. For a general description of the problem see <span id="id14">[<a class="reference internal" href="chapter18.html#id20" title="G. R. North and S. Nakamoto. Formalism for comparing rain estimation designs. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 6(6):985–992, 1989.">19</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The first and most important aspect of the design of any experiment is
to determine <em>why</em> you wish to make a measurement before deciding how
you will make the measurement or what you will measure.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the observations? Do you wish to test hypotheses
or describe processes?</p>
<p>What accuracy is required of the observation?</p>
<p>What resolution in time and space is required? What is the duration of
measurements?</p>
<p>Consider, for example, how the purpose of the measurement changes how
you might measure salinity or temperature as a function of depth:</p>
<p>If the purpose is to describe water masses in an ocean basin, then
measurements with 20–50 m vertical spacing and 50–300 km horizontal
spacing, repeated once per 20–50 years in deep water are required.</p>
<p>If the purpose is to describe vertical mixing in the open equatorial
Pacific, then 0.5–1.0 mm vertical spacing and 50–1000 km spacing
between locations repeated once per hour for many days may be required.</p>

<section id="accuracy-precision-and-linearity">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.5.3. </span>Accuracy, Precision, and Linearity<a class="headerlink" href="#accuracy-precision-and-linearity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>While we are on the topic of experiments, now is a good time to
introduce three concepts needed throughout the book when we discuss
experiments: precision, accuracy, and linearity of a measurement.</p>
<p><em>Accuracy</em> is the difference between the measured value and the true
value.</p>
<p><em>Precision</em> is the difference among repeated measurements.</p>
<p>The distinction between accuracy and precision is usually illustrated by
the simple example of firing a rifle at a target. Accuracy is the
average distance from the center of the target to the hits on the
target. Precision is the average distance between the hits. Thus, ten
rifle shots could be clustered within a circle 10 cm in diameter with
the center of the cluster located 20 cm from the center of the target.
The accuracy is then 20 cm, and the precision is roughly 5 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Linearity</strong> requires that the output of an instrument be a linear function of the input. Nonlinear devices rectify variability to a constant value, so a non-linear response leads to incorrect mean values. Non-linearity can be as important as accuracy. For example:</p>
<p>Let:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Output} &amp;= \text{Input} + 0.1(\text{Input})^2, \\
\text{Input} &amp;= a \sin \omega t.
\end{aligned}
\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Then:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Output} &amp;= a \sin \omega t + 0.1(a \sin \omega t)^2, \\

<p>Note that the mean value of the input is zero, yet the output of this non-linear instrument has a mean value of (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( 0.05 a^2 \)</span>) plus an equally large term at twice the input frequency.</p>
<p>In general, if the <strong>input</strong> has frequencies (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega_1\)</span>) and (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega_2\)</span>), then the <strong>output</strong> of a non-linear instrument contains frequencies (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega_1 \pm \omega_2\)</span>).</p>
<p>Linearity of an instrument is especially important when the instrument must measure the mean value of a turbulent variable. For example, linear current meters are required when measuring currents near the sea surface, where wind and waves produce large variability in the current.</p>

<p>Errors may be correlated with other variables of the problem. For
example, measurements of conductivity are sensitive to temperature. So,
errors in the measurement of temperature in salinometers leads to errors
in the measured values of conductivity or salinity.</p>

<p>From the above, I hope you have learned:</p>
<p>The ocean is not well known. What we know is based on data collected
from only a little more than a century of oceanographic expeditions
supplemented with satellite data collected since 1978.</p>
<p>The basic description of the ocean is sufficient for describing the
time-averaged mean circulation of the ocean, and recent work is
beginning to describe the variability.</p>
<p>Observations are essential for understanding the ocean. Few processes
have been predicted from theory before they were observed.</p>
<p>Lack of observations has led to conceptual pictures of oceanic processes
that are often too simplified and often misleading.</p>
<p>Oceanographers rely more and more on large data sets produced by others.
The sets have errors and limitations which you must understand before
using them.</p>
<p>The planning of experiments is at least as important as conducting the
experiment.</p>
<p>Sampling errors arise when the observations, the samples, are not
representative of the process being studied. Sampling errors are the
largest source of error in oceanography.</p>
<p>Almost all our observations of the ocean now come from satellites,
drifters, and autonomous instruments. Fewer and fewer observations come
from ships at sea.</p>
