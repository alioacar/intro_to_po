    "## Dominant Forces for Ocean Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a few forces are important in physical oceanography: gravity,\n",
    "friction, and Coriolis (table 7.2). Remember that forces are vectors.\n",
    "They have magnitude and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gravity* is the dominant force. The weight of the water in the ocean\n",
    "produces pressure. Changes in gravity, due to the motion of sun and moon\n",
    "relative to earth produces tides, tidal currents, and tidal mixing in\n",
    "the interior of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buoyancy* is the upward or downward force due to gravity acting on a\n",
    "parcel of water that is more or less dense than other water at its\n",
    "level. For example, cold air blowing over the sea cools surface waters\n",
    "causing them to be more dense than the water beneath. Gravity acting on\n",
    "the difference in density results in a force that causes the water to\n",
    "sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Horizontal pressure gradients* are due to the varying weight of water\n",
    "in different regions of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Friction* is the force acting on a body as it moves past another body\n",
    "while in contact with that body. The bodies can be parcels of water or\n",
    "air.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wind stress* is the friction due to wind blowing across the sea\n",
    "surface. It transfers horizontal momentum to the sea, creating currents.\n",
    "Wind blowing over waves on the sea surface leads to an uneven\n",
    "distribution of pressure over the waves. The pressure distribution\n",
    "transfers energy to the waves, causing them to grow into bigger waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pseudo-forces* are apparent forces that arise from motion in\n",
    "curvilinear or rotating coordinate systems. For example, Newtonâ€™s first\n",
    "law states that there is no change in motion of a body unless a\n",
    "resultant force acts on it. Yet a body moving at constant velocity seems\n",
    "to change direction when viewed from a rotating coordinate system. The\n",
    "change in direction is due to a pseudo-force, the Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Coriolis Force* is the dominant pseudo-force influencing motion in a\n",
    "coordinate system fixed to the earth.\n",

    "## Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "Coordinate systems allow us to find locations in theory and practice.\n",
    "Various systems are used depending on the size of the features to be\n",
    "described or mapped. I will refer to the simplest systems; descriptions\n",
    "of other systems can be found in geography and geodesy books.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cartesian Coordinate System* is the one I will use most commonly in the\n",
    "following chapters to keep the discussion as simple as possible. We can\n",
    "describe most processes in Cartesian coordinates without the\n",
    "mathematical complexity of spherical coordinates. The standard\n",
    "convention in geophysical fluid mechanics is $x$ is to the east, $y$ is\n",
    "to the north, and $z$ is up.\n",
    "\n",
    "*f-Plane* is a Cartesian coordinate system in which the Coriolis force\n",
    "is assumed constant. It is useful for describing flow in regions small\n",
    "compared with the radius of the earth and larger than a few tens of\n",
    "kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*$\\beta$-plane* is a Cartesian coordinate system in which the Coriolis\n",
    "force is assumed to vary linearly with latitude. It is useful for\n",
    "describing flow over areas as large as ocean basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spherical coordinates* are used to describe flows that extend over\n",
    "large distances and in numerical calculations of basin and global scale\n",
    "flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Flow in the ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "Many terms are used for describing the ocean circulation. Here are a few\n",
    "of the more commonly used terms for describing currents and waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "*General Circulation* is the permanent, time-averaged circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Abyssal* also called the *Deep Circulation* is the circulation of mass,\n",
    "in the meridional plane, in the deep ocean, driven by mixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wind-Driven Circulation* is the circulation in the upper kilometer of\n",
    "the ocean forced by the wind. The circulation can be caused by local\n",
    "winds or by winds in other regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gyres* are wind-driven cyclonic or anticyclonic currents with\n",
    "dimensions nearly that of ocean basins.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Boundary Currents* are currents flowing parallel to coasts. Two types\n",
    "of boundary currents are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Western boundary currents on the western edge of the ocean tend to be\n",
    "fast, narrow jets such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern boundary currents are weak, *e.g*. the California Current.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Squirts* or *Jets* are long narrow currents, with dimensions of a few\n",
    "hundred kilometers, that are nearly perpendicular to west coasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mesoscale Eddies* are turbulent or spinning flows on scales of a few\n",
    "hundred kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to flow due to currents, there are many types of oscillatory\n",
    "flows due to waves. Normally, when we think of waves in the ocean, we\n",
    "visualize waves breaking on the beach or the surface waves influencing\n",
    "ships at sea. But many other types of waves occur in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planetary Waves* depend on the rotation of the earth for a restoring\n",
    "force, and they including Rossby, Kelvin, Equatorial, and Yanai waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Surface Waves* sometimes called gravity waves, are the waves that\n",
    "eventually break on the beach. The restoring force is due to the large\n",
    "density contrast between air and water at the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Internal Waves* are sub-sea wave similar in some respects to surface\n",
    "waves. The restoring force is due to change in density with depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tsunamis* are surface waves with periods near 15 minutes generated by\n",
    "earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tidal Currents* are horizontal currents and currents associated with\n",
    "internal waves driven by the tidal potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Edge Waves* are surface waves with periods of a few minutes confined to\n",
    "shallow regions near shore. The amplitude of the waves drops off\n",
    "exponentially with distance from shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conservation of Mass and Salt\n",
    "\n",
    "Conservation of mass and salt can be used to obtain very useful\n",
    "information about flows in the ocean. For example, suppose we wish to\n",
    "know the net loss of fresh water, evaporation minus precipitation, from\n",
    "the Mediterranean Sea. We could carefully calculate the latent heat flux\n",
    "over the surface, but there are probably too few ship reports for an\n",
    "accurate application of the bulk formula. Or we could carefully measure\n",
    "the mass of water flowing in and out of the sea through the Strait of\n",
    "Gibraltar, but the difference is small and perhaps impossible to measure\n",
    "accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, however, calculate the net evaporation knowing the salinity of\n",
    "the flow in $S_i$ and out $S_o$, together with a rough estimate of the\n",
    "volume of water $V_o$ flowing out, where $V_o$ is a volume flow in units\n",
    "of m$^3$/s (figure 7.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7.1 Schematic\n",
    "\n",
    "diagram of flow into and out of a basin.  \n",
    "Values from Bryden and Kinder (1991).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fig:basin\" label=\"fig:basin\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass flowing out is, by definition, $\\rho_o \\, V_o$. If the volume\n",
    "of the sea does not change, conservation of mass requires:\n",
    "$$\\rho_i\\,V_i = \\rho_o\\,V_o$$ where, $\\rho_i, \\,\\rho_o$ are the\n",
    "densities of the water flowing in and out. We can usually assume, with\n",
    "little error, that $\\rho_i = \\rho_o$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is precipitation $P$ and evaporation $E$ at the surface of the\n",
    "basin and river inflow $R$, conservation of mass becomes:\n",
    "$$V_i + R + P = V_o + E$$ Solving for ($V_o$ - $V_i$):\n",
    "$$V_o - V_i = (R + P) - E$$ which states that the net flow of water into\n",
    "the basin must balance precipitation plus river inflow minus evaporation\n",
    "when averaged over a sufficiently long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because salt is not deposited or removed from the sea, conservation of\n",
    "salt requires : $$\\rho_i\\,V_i\\,S_i = \\rho_o\\,V_o\\,S_o$$ Where $\\rho_i$,\n",
    "$S_i$ are the density and salinity of the incoming water, and $\\rho_o$,\n",
    "$S_o$ are density and salinity of the outflow. With little error, we can\n",
    "again assume that $\\rho_i$ = $\\rho_o$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### An Example of Conservation of Mass and Salt\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the values for the flow at the Strait of Gibraltar measured by\n",
    "Bryden and Kinder (1991) and shown in figure 7.1, solving (7.4) for\n",
    "$V_i$ assuming that $\\rho_i = \\rho_o$, and using the estimated value of\n",
    "$V_o$, gives $V_i = 0.836$ Sv $= 0.836 \\times 10^6$ m$^3$/s, where Sv =\n",
    "Sverdrup $= 10^6$ m$^3$/s is the unit of volume transport used in\n",
    "oceanography. Using $V_i$ and $V_o$ in (7.3) gives\n",
    "$(R + P - E) = - 4.6 \\times 10^4$ m$^3$/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing $V_i$ we can also calculate a minimum flushing time for\n",
    "replacing water in the sea by incoming water. The minimum flushing time\n",
    "$T_m$ is the volume of the sea divided by the volume of incoming water.\n",
    "The Mediterranean has a volume of around $4 \\times 10^6$ km$^3$.\n",
    "Converting $0.836 \\times 10^6$ m$^3$/s to km$^3$/yr we obtain\n",
    "$2.64 \\times10^4$ km$^3$/yr. Then, $T_m = 4 \\times 10^6$ km$^3$/$2.64 \\times 10^4$ km$^3$/yr $= 151$ yr. The actual time depends on mixing\n",
    "within the sea. If the waters are well mixed, the flushing time is close\n",
    "to the minimum time, if they are not well mixed, the flushing time is\n",
    "longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example of flow into and out of the Mediterranean Sea is an example\n",
    "of a *box model*. A box model replaces large systems, such as the\n",
    "Mediterranean Sea, with boxes. Fluids or chemicals or organisms can move\n",
    "between boxes, and conservation equations are used to constrain the\n",
    "interactions within systems.\n",

    "differential calculus. For example, if we subdivide the flow of water\n",
    "into boxes a few meters on a side, and if we use conservation of mass,\n",

    "differential equations governing fluid flow.\n",

    "Consider the example of acceleration of flow in a small box of fluid.\n",
    "The resulting equation is called the *total derivative*. It relates the\n",
    "acceleration of a particle $Du/Dt$ to derivatives of the velocity field\n",
    "at a fixed point in the fluid. We will use the equation to derive the\n",
