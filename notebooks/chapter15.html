<p>We saw earlier that analytic solutions of the equations of motion are
impossible to obtain for typical oceanic flows. The problem is due to
non-linear terms in the equations of motion, turbulence, and the need
for realistic shapes for the sea floor and coastlines. We have also seen
how difficult it is to describe the ocean from measurements. Satellites
can observe some processes almost everywhere every few days. But they
observe only some processes, and only near or at the surface. Ships and
floats can measure more variables, and deeper into the water, but the
measurements are sparse. Hence, numerical models provide the only
useful, global view of ocean currents. Let’s look at the accuracy and
validity of the models, keeping in mind that although they are only
models, they provide a remarkably detailed and realistic view of the
ocean.</p>
<section id="introductionsome-words-of-caution">
<h2><span class="section-number">15.1. </span>Introduction–Some Words of Caution<a class="headerlink" href="#introductionsome-words-of-caution" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Numerical models of ocean currents have many advantages. They simulate
flows in realistic ocean basins with a realistic sea floor. They include
the influence of viscosity and non-linear dynamics. And they can
calculate possible future flows in the ocean. Perhaps, most important,
they interpolate between sparse observations of the ocean produced by
ships, drifters, and satellites.</p>
<p>Numerical models are not without problems. “There is a world of
difference between the character of the fundamental laws, on the one
hand, and the nature of the computations required to breathe life into
them, on the other”—Berlinski (1996). The models can never give
complete descriptions of the oceanic flows even if the equations are
integrated accurately. The problems arise from several sources.</p>
<p><em>Discrete equations are not the same as continuous equations.</em> In
Chapter 7 we wrote down the differential equations describing the motion
of a continuous fluid. Numerical models use algebraic approximations to
the differential equations. We assume that the ocean basins are filled
with a grid of points, and time moves forward in tiny steps. The value
of the current, pressure, temperature, and salinity are calculated from
their values at nearby points and previous times. Ian Stewart (1992), a
noted mathematician, points out that</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Discretization is essential for computer implementation and cannot be
dispensed with. The essence of the difficulty is that the dynamics of
discrete systems is only loosely related to that of continuous
systems—indeed the dynamics of discrete systems is far richer than
that of their continuous counterparts—and the approximations
involved can create spurious solutions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Calculations of turbulence are difficult.</em> Numerical models provide
information only at grid points of the model. They provide no
information about the flow between the points. Yet, the ocean is
turbulent, and any oceanic model capable of resolving the turbulence
needs grid points spaced millimeters apart, with time steps of
milliseconds.</p>
<p>Practical ocean models have grid points spaced tens to hundreds of
kilometers apart in the horizontal, and tens to hundreds of meters apart
in the vertical. This means that turbulence cannot be calculated
directly, and the influence of turbulence must be parameterized.
Holloway (1994) states the problem succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ocean models retain fewer degrees of freedom than the actual ocean (by
about 20 orders of magnitude). We compensate by applying ‘eddy-viscous
goo’ to squash motion at all but the smallest retained scales. (We
also use non-conservative numerics.) This is analogous to placing a
partition in a box to prevent gas molecules from invading another
region of the box. Our oceanic models cannot invade most of the real
oceanic degrees of freedom simply because the models do not include
them.</p>
<p>Given that we cannot do things ‘right’, is it better to do nothing?
That is not an option. ‘Nothing’ means applying viscous goo and
wishing for the ever bigger computer. Can we do better? For example,
can we guess a higher entropy configuration toward which the eddies
tend to drive the ocean (that tendency to compete with the imposed
forcing and dissipation)?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>By “degrees of freedom” Holloway means all possible motions from the
smallest waves and turbulence to the largest currents. Let’s do a
calculation. We know that the ocean is turbulent with eddies as small as
a few millimeters. To completely describe the ocean we need a model with
grid points spaced 1 mm apart and time steps of about 1 ms. The model
must therefore have 360 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 180<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> (111
km/degree)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2 \times 10^{12}\)</span> (mm/km)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2 \times\)</span> 3 km <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times 10^6\)</span>
(mm/km) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= 2.4 \times 10^{27}\)</span> data points for a 3 km deep ocean
covering the globe. The global Parallel Ocean Program Model described in
the next section has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.2 \times 10^7\)</span> points. So we need <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{20}\)</span> times more points to describe
the real ocean. These are the missing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{20}\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p><em>Practical models must be simpler than the real ocean.</em> Models of the
ocean must run on available computers. This means oceanographers further
simplify their models. We use the hydrostatic and Boussinesq
approximations, and we often use equations integrated in the vertical,
the shallow-water equations (Haidvogel and Beckmann, 1999: 37). We do
this because we cannot yet run the most detailed models of oceanic
circulation for thousands of years to understand the role of the ocean
in climate.</p>
<p><em>Numerical code has errors.</em> Do you know of any software without bugs?
Numerical models use many subroutines each with many lines of code which
are converted into instructions understood by processors using other
software called a compiler. Eliminating all software errors is
impossible. With careful testing, the output may be correct, but the
accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Plus, numerical calculations cannot be
more accurate than the accuracy of the floating-point numbers and
integers used by the computer. Round-off errors cannot be ignored.
Lawrence et al (1999), examining the output of an atmospheric numerical
model found an error in the code produced by the
<span class="smallcaps">fortran-90</span> compiler used on the <span class="smallcaps">cray</span>
Research supercomputer used to run the code. They also found round-off
errors in the concentration of tracers calculated from the model. Both
errors produced important errors in the output of the model.</p>
<p>Most models are not well verified or validated (Post &amp; Votta, 2005).
Yet, without adequate verification and validation, output from numerical
models is not credible.</p>

Numerical models of the ocean are giving the most detailed and complete
views of the circulation available to oceanographers. Some of the
simulations contain unprecedented details of the flow. I included the

<h2><span class="section-number">15.2. </span>Numerical Models in Oceanography<a class="headerlink" href="#numerical-models-in-oceanography" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Numerical models are very widely used for many purposes in oceanography.
For our purpose we can divide models into two classes:</p>
<section id="mechanistic-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.2.1. </span>Mechanistic models<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanistic-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>are simplified models used for studying processes. Because the models
are simplified, the output is easier to interpret than output from more
complex models. Many different types of simplified models have been
developed, including models for describing planetary waves, the
interaction of the flow with sea-floor features, or the response of the
upper ocean to the wind. These are perhaps the most useful of all models
because they provide insight into the physical mechanisms influencing
the ocean. The development and use of mechanistic models is,
unfortunately, beyond the scope of this book.</p>
</section>
<section id="simulation-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.2.2. </span>Simulation models<a class="headerlink" href="#simulation-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>are used for calculating realistic circulation of oceanic regions. The
models are often very complex because all important processes are
included, and the output is difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>The first simulation model was developed by Kirk Bryan and Michael Cox
(Bryan, 1969) at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory in Princeton.
They calculated the 3-dimensional flow in the ocean using the continuity
and momentum equation with the hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations
and a simple equation of state. Such models are called <em>primitive
equation</em> models because they use the basic, or primitive form of the
equations of motion. The equation of state allows the model to calculate
changes in density due to fluxes of heat and water through the surface,
so the model includes thermodynamic processes.</p>
<p>The Bryan-Cox model used large horizontal and vertical viscosity and
diffusion to eliminate turbulent eddies having diameters smaller about
500 km, which is a few grid points in the model. It had complex
coastlines, smoothed sea-floor features, and a rigid lid. The rigid lid
was needed to eliminate ocean-surface waves, such as tides and tsunamis,
that move far too fast for the coarse time steps used by all simulation
models. The rigid lid had, however, disadvantages. Islands substantially
slowed the computation, and the sea-floor features were smoothed to
eliminate steep gradients.</p>
<p>The first simulation model was regional. It was quickly followed by a
global model (Cox, 1975) with a horizontal resolution of 2 and with 12
levels in the vertical. The model ran far too slowly even on the fastest
computers of the day, but it laid the foundation for more recent models.
The coarse spatial resolution required that the model have large values
for viscosity, and even regional models were too viscous to have
realistic western boundary currents or mesoscale eddies.</p>
<p>Since those times, the goal has been to produce models with ever finer
resolution, more realistic modeling of physical processes, and better
numerical schemes. Computer technology is changing rapidly, and models
are evolving rapidly. The output from the most recent models of the
north Atlantic, which have resolution of 0.03 look very much like the
real ocean. Models of other areas show previously unknown currents near
Australia and in the south Atlantic.</p>

<section id="ocean-and-atmosphere-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.2.3. </span>Ocean and Atmosphere Models<a class="headerlink" href="#ocean-and-atmosphere-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>use very different spacing of grid points. As a result, ocean modeling
lags about a decade behind atmosphere modeling. Dominant ocean eddies
are 1/30 the size of dominant atmosphere eddies (storms). But, ocean
features evolve at a rate that is 1/30 the rate in the atmosphere. Thus
ocean models running for say one year have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((30 \times 30 )\)</span> more
horizontal grid points than the atmosphere, but they have 1/30 the
number of time steps. Both have about the same number of grid points in
the vertical. As a result, ocean models run 30 times slower than
atmosphere models of the same complexity.</p>

<section id="global-ocean-models">
<h2><span class="section-number">15.3. </span>Global Ocean Models<a class="headerlink" href="#global-ocean-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Several types of global models are widely used in oceanography. Most
have grid points about one tenth of a degree apart, which is sufficient
to resolve mesoscale eddies, such as those seen in figures 11.10, 11.11,
and 15.2, that have a diameter larger than two to three times the
distance between grid points. Vertical resolution is typically around 30
vertical levels. Models include: i) realistic coasts and bottom
features; ii) heat and water fluxes though the surface; iii) eddy
dynamics; and iv) the meridional-overturning circulation. Many
assimilate satellite and float data using techniques described in §15.5.
The models range in complexity from those that can run on desktop
workstations to those that require the world’s fastest computers.</p>
<p>All models must be be run to calculate one to two decades of variability
before they can be used to simulate the ocean. This is called <em>spin-up</em>.
Spin-up is needed because initial conditions for density, fluxes of
momentum and heat through the sea-surface, and the equations of motion
are not all consistent. Models are started from rest with values of
density from the Levitus (1982) atlas and integrated for a decade using
mean-annual wind stress, heat fluxes, and water flux. The model may be
integrated for several more years using monthly wind stress, heat
fluxes, and water fluxes.</p>
<p>The Bryan-Cox models evolved into several widely used models which are
providing impressive views of the global ocean circulation.</p>
<section id="geophysical-fluid-dynamics-laboratory-modular-ocean-model-mom">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.3.1. </span>Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Modular Ocean Model MOM<a class="headerlink" href="#geophysical-fluid-dynamics-laboratory-modular-ocean-model-mom" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>consistsof a large set of modules that can be configured to run on many
different computersto model many different aspects of the circulation.
The source code is open and free, and it is in the public domain. The
model is widely use for climate studies and for studying the ocean’s
circulation over a wide range of space and time scales (Pacanowski and
Griffies, 1999).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Because <span class="smallcaps">mom</span> is used to investigate processes which cover
a wide range of time and space scales, the code and manual are
lengthy. However, it is far from necessary for the typical ocean
modeler to become acquainted with all of its aspects. Indeed,
<span class="smallcaps">mom</span> can be likened to a growing city with many different
neighborhoods. Some of the neighborhoods communicate with one another,
some are mutually incompatible, and others are basically independent.
This diversity is quite a challenge to coordinate and support. Indeed,
over the years certain “neighborhoods” have been jettisoned or greatly
renovated for various reasons.—Pacanowski and Griffies.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The model uses the momentum equations, equation of state, and the
hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. Subgrid-scale motions are
reduced by use of eddy viscosity. Version 4 of the model has improved
numerical schemes, a free surface, realistic bottom features, and many
types of mixing including horizontal mixing along surfaces of constant
density. Plus, it can be coupled to atmospheric models.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">hycom</span> All the models just described use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x, y, z\)</span>
coordinates. Such a coordinate system has both advantages and
disadvantages. It can have high resolution in the surface mixed layer
and in shallower regions. But it is less useful in the interior of the
ocean. Below the mixed layer, mixing in the ocean is easy along surfaces
of constant density, and difficult across such surfaces. A more natural
coordinate system in the interior of the ocean uses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x, y, \rho\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> is density. Such a model is called an <em>isopycnal model</em>.
Essentially, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho (z)\)</span> is replaced with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z (\rho )\)</span>. Because isopycnal

from the Miami Isopycnic-Coordinate Ocean Model (figure 15.2). It is a
primitive-equation model driven by wind stress and heat fluxes. It has
realistic mixed layer and improved horizontal and vertical mixing
schemes that include the influences of internal waves, shear

<section id="coastal-models">
<h2><span class="section-number">15.4. </span>Coastal Models<a class="headerlink" href="#coastal-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The great economic importance of the coastal zone has led to the
development of many different numerical models for describing coastal
currents, tides, and storm surges. The models extend from the beach to
the continental slope, and they can include a free surface, realistic
coasts and bottom features, river runoff, and atmospheric forcing.
Because the models don’t extend very far into deep water, they need
additional information about deep-water currents or conditions at the
shelf break.</p>
<p>The many different coastal models have many different goals, and many
different implementations. Several of the models described above,
including <span class="smallcaps">mom</span> and <span class="smallcaps">rom</span>, have been used to
model coastal processes. But many other specialized models have also
been developed. Heaps (1987), Lynch et al (1996), and Haidvogel and
Beckman (1998) provide good overviews of the subject. Rather than look
at a menu of models, let’s look at two typical models.</p>
<p><em>Princeton Ocean Model</em> developed by Blumberg and Mellor (1987, and
Mellor, 1998) and is widely used for describing coastal currents. It
includes thermodynamic processes, turbulent mixing, and the Boussinesq
and hydrostatic approximations. The Coriolis parameter is allowed to
vary using a beta-plane approximation. Because the model must include a
wide range of depths, Blumberg and Mellor used a vertical coordinate
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> scaled by the depth of the water:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma = \frac{z-\eta}{H+\eta}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where \)</span>z=\eta(x, y, t)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the sea
surface, and \)</span>z=-H(x,y)$ is the bottom.</p>
<p>Sub-grid turbulence is parameterized using a closure scheme proposed by
Mellor and Yamada (1982) whereby eddy diffusion coefficients vary with
the size of the eddies producing the mixing and the shear of the flow.</p>
<p>The model is driven by wind stress and heat and water fluxes from
meteorological models. The model uses known geostrophic, tidal, and
Ekman currents at the outer boundary.</p>
<p>The model has been used to calculate the three-dimensional distribution
of velocity, salinity, sea level, temperature, and turbulence for up to
30 days over a region roughly 100–1000 km on a side with grid spacing
of 1–50 km.</p>
<p><em>Dartmouth Gulf of Maine Model</em> developed by Lynch et al (1996) is a
3-dimensional model of the circulation using a triangular,
finite-element grid. The size of the triangles is proportional to both
depth and the rate of change of depth. The triangles are small in
regions where the bottom slopes are large and the depth is shallow, and
they are large in deep water. The variable mesh is especially useful in
coastal regions where the depth of water varies greatly. Thus the
variable grid gives highest resolution where it is most needed.</p>
<p>Figure 15.3 <strong>Top</strong>: Topographic</p>
<p>map of the Gulf of Maine showing important features. <strong>Inset</strong>:
Triangular, finite-element grid used to compute flow in the gulf. The
size of the triangles varies with depth and rate of change of depth.
After Lynch et al, (1996). <span id="fig:GulfofMaine" label="fig:GulfofMaine"></span></p>
<p>The model uses roughly 13,000 triangles to cover the Gulf of Maine and
nearby waters of the north Atlantic (figures 15.3). Minimum size of the
elements is roughly one kilometer. The model has 10 to 40 horizontal
layers. The vertical spacing of the layers is not uniform. Layers are
closer together near the top and bottom and they are more widely spaced
in the interior. Minimum spacing is roughly one meter in the bottom
boundary layer.</p>
<p>The model integrates the three-dimensional, primitive equations in
shallow-water form. The model has a simplified equation of state and a
depth-averaged continuity equation, and it uses the hydrostatic and
Boussinesq assumptions. Sub-grid mixing of momentum, heat and mass is
parameterized using the Mellor and Yamada (1982) turbulence-closure
scheme which gives vertical mixing coefficients that vary with
stratification and velocity shear. Horizontal mixing coefficients were
calculated from Smagorinski (1963). A carefully chosen, turbulent, eddy
viscosity is used in the bottom boundary layer. The model is forced by
wind, heating, and tidal forcing from the deep ocean.</p>
<p>The model is spun up from rest for a few days using a specified density
field at all grid points, usually from a combination of
<span class="smallcaps">ctd</span> data plus historical data. This gives a velocity field
consistent with the density field. The model is then forced with local
winds and heat fluxes to calculate the evolution of the density and
velocity fields.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">15.4.1. </span>Comments on Coastal Models<a class="headerlink" href="#comments-on-coastal-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Roed et al. (1995) examined the accuracy of coastal models by comparing
the ability of five models, including Blumberg and Mellor’s to describe
the flow in typical cases. They found that the models produced very
different results, but that after the models were adjusted, the
differences were reduced. The differences were due to differences in
vertical and horizontal mixing and spatial and temporal resolution.</p>
<p>Hackett et al. (1995) compared the ability of two of the five models to
describe observed flow on the Norwegian shelf. They conclude that</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>…both models are able to qualitatively generate many of the observed
features of the flow, but neither is able to quantitatively reproduce
detailed currents …[Differences] are primarily attributable to
inadequate parameterizations of subgrid scale turbulent mixing, to

conditions.</p>

<section id="storm-surge-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.4.2. </span>Storm-Surge Models<a class="headerlink" href="#storm-surge-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Storms coming ashore across wide, shallow, continental shelves drive
large changes of sea level at the coast called storm surges (see §17.3
for a description of surges and processes influencing surges). The
surges can cause great damage to coasts and coastal structures. Intense
storms in the Bay of Bengal have killed hundreds of thousands in a few
days in Bangladesh. Because surges are so important, government agencies
in many countries have developed models to predict the changes of sea
level and the extent of coastal flooding.</p>
<p>Calculating storm surges is not easy. Here are some reasons, in a rough
order of importance.</p>
<p>The distribution of wind over the ocean is not well known. Numerical
weather models calculate wind speed at a constant pressure surface,
storm-surge models need wind at a constant height of 10 m. Winds in bays
and lagoons tend to be weaker than winds just offshore because nearby
land distorts the airflow, and this is not included in the weather
models.</p>
<p>The shoreward extent of the model’s domain changes with time. For
example, if sea level rises, water will flood inland, and the boundary
between water and sea moves inland with the water.</p>
<p>The drag coefficient of wind on water is not well known for hurricane
force winds.</p>
<p>The drag coefficient of water on the seafloor is also not well known.</p>
<p>The models must include waves and tides which influence sea level in
shallow waters.</p>
<p>Storm surge models must include the currents generated in a stratified,
shallow sea by wind.</p>
<p>To reduce errors, models are tuned to give results that match conditions
seen in past storms. Unfortunately, those past conditions are not well
known. Changes in sea level and wind speed are rarely recorded
accurately in storms except at a few, widely paced locations. Yet
storm-surge heights can change by more than a meter over distances of
tens of kilometers.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, models give very useful results. Let’s look at
the official <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> model, and a new experimental model
developed by the Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p><em>Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges Model</em> <span class="smallcaps">slosh</span> is used by
<span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> for forecasting storm surges produced by hurricanes
coming ashore along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States
(Jelesnianski, Chen, and Shaffer, 1992).</p>
<p>The model is the result of a lifetime of work by Chester Jelesnianski.
In developing the model, Jelesnianski paid careful attention to the
relative importance of errors in the model. He worked to reduce the
largest errors, and ignored the smaller ones. For example, the
distribution of winds in a hurricane is not well known, so it makes
little sense to use a spatially varying drag coefficient for the wind.
Thus, Jelesnianski used a constant drag coefficient in the air, and a
constant eddy stress coefficient in the water.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">slosh</span> calculates water level from depth-integrated,
quasi-linear, shallow-water equations. Thus it ignores stratification.
It also ignores river inflow, rain, and tides. The latter may seem
strange, but the model is designed for forecasting. The time of landfall
cannot be forecast accurately, and hence the height of the tides is
mostly unknown. Tides can be added to the calculated surge, but the
nonlinear interaction of tides and surge is ignored.</p>
<p>The model is forced by idealized hurricane winds. It needs only
atmospheric pressure at the center of the storm, the distance from the
center to the area of maximum winds, the forecast storm track and speed
along the track.</p>
<p>In preparation for hurricanes coming ashore near populated areas, the
model has been adapted for 27 basins from Boston Harbor Massachusetts to
Laguna Madre Texas. The model uses a fixed polar mesh. Mesh spacing
begins with a fine mesh near the pole, which is located near the coastal
city for which the model is adapted. The grid stretches continuously to
a coarse mesh at distant boundaries of a large basin. Such a mesh gives
high resolution in bays and near the coast where resolution is most
needed. Using measured depths at sea and elevations on land, the model
allows flooding of land, overtopping of levees and dunes, and sub-grid
flow through channels between offshore islands.</p>
<p>Sea level calculated from the model has been compared with heights
measured by tide gauges for 13 storms, including Betsy: 1965, Camile:
1969, Donna: 1960, and Carla: 1961. The overall accuracy is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 20\)</span>% .</p>
<p><em>Advanced Circulation Model</em> <span class="smallcaps">adcirc</span> is an experimental
model for forecasting storm surges produced by hurricanes coming ashore
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States (Graber et al,
2006). The model uses a finite-element grid, the Boussinesq
approximation, quadratic bottom friction, and vertically integrated
continuity and momentum equations for flow on a rotating earth. It can
be run as either a two-dimensional, depth-integrated model, or as a
three-dimensional model. Because waves contribute to storm surges, the
model includes waves calculated from the <span class="smallcaps">wam</span>
third-geneation wave model (see §16.5).</p>
<p>The model is forced by:</p>
<p>High resolution winds and surface pressure obtained by combining weather
forecasts from the <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> National Weather Service and the
National Hurricane Center along the official and alternate forecast
storm tracks.</p>
<p>Tides at the open-ocean boundaries of the model.</p>
<p>Sea-surface height and currents at the open-ocean boundaries of the
model.</p>
<p>The model successfully forecast the Hurricane Katrina storm surge,
giving values in excess of 6.1 m near New Orleans.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">15.5. </span>Assimilation Models<a class="headerlink" href="#assimilation-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Many of the models I have described so far have output, such as current
velocity or surface topography, constrained by oceanic observations of
the variables they calculate. Such models are called <em>assimilation
models</em>. In this section, I will consider how data can be assimilated
into numerical models.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a primitive-equation, eddy-admitting numerical model
used to calculate the position of the Gulf Stream. Let’s assume that the
model is driven with real-time surface winds from the
<span class="smallcaps">ecmwf</span> weather model. Using the model, we can calculate the
position of the current and also the sea-surface topography associated
with the current. We find that the position of the Gulf Stream wiggles
offshore of Cape Hatteras due to instabilities, and the position
calculated by the model is just one of many possible positions for the
same wind forcing. Which position is correct, that is, what is the
position of the current today? We know, from satellite altimetry, the
position of the current at a few points a few days ago. Can we use this
information to calculate the current’s position today? How do we
assimilate this information into the model?</p>
<p>Many different approaches are being explored (Malanotte-Rizzoli, 1996).
Roger Daley (1991) gives a complete description of how data are used
with atmospheric models. Andrew Bennet (1992) and Carl Wunsch (1996)
describe oceanic applications.</p>
<p>The different approaches are necessary because assimilation of data into
models is not easy.</p>
<p>Data assimilation is an <em>inverse problem</em>: A finite number of
observations are used to estimate a continuous field—a function, which
has an infinite number of points. The calculated fields, the solution to
the inverse problem, are completely under-determined. There are many
fields that fit the observations and the model precisely, and the
solutions are not unique. In our example, the position of the Gulf
Stream is a function. We may not need an infinite number of values to
specify the position of the stream if we assume the position is somewhat
smooth in space. But we certainly need hundreds of values along the
stream’s axis. Yet, we have only a few satellite points to constrain the
position of the Stream.</p>
<p>To learn more about inverse problems and their solution, read Parker
(1994) who gives a very good introduction based on geophysical examples.</p>
<p>Ocean dynamics are non-linear, while most methods for calculating
solutions to inverse problems depend on linear approximations. For
example the position of the Gulf Stream is a very nonlinear function of
the forcing by wind and heat fluxes over the north Atlantic.</p>
<p>Both the model and the data are incomplete and both have errors. For
example, we have altimeter measurements only along the tracks such as
those shown in figure 2.6, and the measurements have errors of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 2\)</span>
cm.</p>
<p>Most data available for assimilation into data comes from the surface,
such as <span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> and altimeter data. Surface data obviously
constrain the surface geostrophic velocity, and surface velocity is
related to deeper velocities. The trick is to couple the surface
observations to deeper currents.</p>
<p>While various techniques are used to constrain numerical models in
oceanography, perhaps the most practical are techniques borrowed from
meteorology.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Most major ocean currents have dynamics which are significantly
nonlinear. This precludes the ready development of inverse
methods…Accordingly, most attempts to combine ocean models and
measurements have followed the practice in operational meteorology:
measurements are used to prepare initial conditions for the model,
which is then integrated forward in time until further measurements
are available. The model is thereupon re-initialized. Such a strategy
may be described as sequential.—Bennet (1992).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see how Professor Allan Robinson and colleagues at Harvard
University used sequential estimation techniques to make the first
forecasts of the Gulf Stream using a very simple model.</p>
<p><em>The Harvard Open-Ocean Model</em> was an eddy-admitting, quasi-geostropic
model of the Gulf Stream east of Cape Hatteras (Robinson et al. 1989).
It had six levels in the vertical, 15 km resolution, and one-hour time
steps. It used a filter to smooth high-frequency variability and to damp
grid-scale variability.</p>
<p><span class="image">image</span> Figure 15.4 Output</p>
<p>from the Harvard Open-Ocean Model: <strong>A</strong> the initial state of the model,
the analysis, and <strong>B</strong> Data used to produce the analysis for 2 March
1988. <strong>C</strong> The forecast for 9 March 1988. <strong>D</strong> The analysis for 9
March. Although the Gulf Stream changed substantially in one week, the
model forecasts the changes well. After Robinson et al. (1989).
<span id="fig:harvardmodel" label="fig:harvardmodel"></span></p>
<p>By <em>quasi-geostrophic</em> we mean that the flow field is close to
geostrophic balance. The equations of motion include the acceleration
terms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D/Dt\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D/Dt\)</span> is the substantial derivative and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is
time. The flow can be stratified, but there is no change in density due
to heat fluxes or vertical mixing. Thus the quasi-geostrophic equations
are simpler than the primitive equations, and they could be integrated
much faster. Cushman-Roisin (1994: 204) gives a good description of the
development of quasi-geostrophic equations of motion.</p>
<p>The model reproduces the important features of the Gulf Stream and it’s
extension, including meanders, cold- and warm-core rings, the
interaction of rings with the stream, and baroclinic instability (figure
15.4). Because the model was designed to forecast the dynamics of the
Gulf Stream, it must be constrained by oceanic measurements:</p>
<p>Data provide the initial conditions for the model. Satellite
measurements of sea-surface temperature from the <span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> and
topography from an altimeter are used to determine the location of
features in the region. Expendable bathythermograph, <span class="smallcaps">axbt</span>
measurements of subsurface temperature, and historical measurements of
internal density are also used. The features are represented by an
analytic functions in the model.</p>
<p>The data are introduced into the numerical model, which interpolates and
smoothes the data to produce the best estimate of the initial fields of
density and velocity. The resulting fields are called an <em>analysis</em>.</p>
<p>The model is integrated forward for one week, when new data are
available, to produce a forecast.</p>
<p>Finally, the new data are introduced into the model as in the first step
above, and the processes is repeated.</p>
<p>The model made useful, one-week forecasts of the Gulf Stream region.
Much more advanced models with much higher resolution are now being used
to make global forecasts of ocean currents up to one month in advance in
support of the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment
<span class="smallcaps">godae</span> that started in 2003. The goal of
<span class="smallcaps">godae</span> is produce routine oceanic forecasts similar to
todays weather forecasts.</p>
<p>An example of a <span class="smallcaps">godae</span> model is the global US Navy Layered
Ocean Model. It is a primitive equation model with 1/32 resolution in
the horizontal and seven layers in the vertical. It assimilates
altimeter data from Jason, Geosat Follow-on (<span class="smallcaps">gfo</span>), and
<span class="smallcaps">ers</span>-2 satellites and sea-surface temperature from
<span class="smallcaps">avhrr</span> on <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> satellites. The model is
forced with winds and heat fluxes for up to five days in the future
using output from the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction
System. Beyond five days, seasonal mean winds and fluxes are used. The
model is run daily (figure 15.5) and produces forecasts for up to one
month in the future. The model has useful skill out to about 20 days.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">15.6. </span>Coupled Ocean and Atmosphere Models<a class="headerlink" href="#coupled-ocean-and-atmosphere-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Coupled numerical models of the atmosphere and ocean are used to study
the climate, its variability, and its response to external forcing. The
most important use of the models has been to study how earth’s climate
might respond to a doubling of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(CO_{2}\)</span> in the atmosphere. Much of the
literature on climate change is based on studies using such models.
Other important uses of coupled models include studies of El Niño and
the meridional overturning circulation. The former varies over a few
years, the latter varies over a few centuries.</p>
<p>Development of the coupled models tends to be coordinated through the
World Climate Research Program of the World Meteorological Organization
<span class="smallcaps">wcrp/wmo</span>, and recent progress is summarized in Chapter 8
of the <em>Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis</em> report by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<span class="smallcaps">ipcc</span>, 2007).</p>
<p>Many coupled ocean and atmosphere models have been developed. Some
include only physical processes in the ocean, atmosphere, and the
ice-covered polar seas. Others add the influence of land and biological
activity in the ocean. Let’s look at the oceanic components of a few
models.</p>
<section id="climate-system-model">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.6.1. </span>Climate System Model<a class="headerlink" href="#climate-system-model" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Climate System Model developed by the National Center for
Atmospheric Research <span class="smallcaps">ncar</span> includes physical and
biogeochemical influence on the climate system (Boville and Gent, 1998).
It has atmosphere, ocean, land-surface, and sea-ice components coupled
by fluxes between components. The atmospheric component is the
<span class="smallcaps">ncar</span> Community Climate Model, the oceanic component is a
modified version of the Princeton Modular Ocean Model, using the Gent
and McWilliams (1990) scheme for parameterizing mesoscale eddies.
Resolution is approximately 2 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 2 with 45 vertical levels in the
ocean.</p>
<p>The model has been spun up and integrated for 300 years, the results are
realistic, and there is no need for a flux adjustment. (See the special
issue of <em>Journal of Climate</em>, June 1998).</p>

<section id="princeton-coupled-model">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.6.2. </span>Princeton Coupled Model<a class="headerlink" href="#princeton-coupled-model" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The model consists of an atmospheric model with a horizontal resolution
of 7.5 longitude by 4.5 latitude and 9 levels in the vertical, an ocean
model with a horizontal resolution of 4 and 12 levels in the vertical,
and a land-surface model. The ocean and atmosphere are coupled through
heat, water, and momentum fluxes. Land and ocean are coupled through
river runoff. And land and atmosphere are coupled through water and heat
fluxes.</p>

<section id="hadley-center-model">
<h3><span class="section-number">15.6.3. </span>Hadley Center Model<a class="headerlink" href="#hadley-center-model" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is an atmosphere-ocean-ice model that minimizes the need for flux
adjustments (Johns et al, 1997). The ocean component is based on the
Bryan-Cox primitive equation model, with realistic bottom features,
vertical mixing coefficients from Pacanowski and Philander (1981). Both
the ocean and the atmospheric component have a horizontal resolution of
96 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\times\)</span> 73 grid points, the ocean has 20 levels in the vertical.</p>
<p>In contrast to most coupled models, this one is spun up as a coupled
system with flux adjustments during spin up to keep sea surface
temperature and salinity close to observed mean values. The coupled
model was integrated from rest using Levitus values for temperature and
salinity for September. The initial integration was from 1850 to 1940.
The model was then integrated for another 1000 years. No flux adjustment
was necessary after the initial 140-year integration because drift of
global-averaged air temperature was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\le 0.016\)</span> K/century.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">15.6.4. </span>Comments on Accuracy of Coupled Models<a class="headerlink" href="#comments-on-accuracy-of-coupled-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Models of the coupled, land-air-ice-ocean climate system must simulate
hundreds to thousands of years. Yet,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It will be very hard to establish an integration framework,
particularly on a global scale, as present capabilities for modelling
the earth system are rather limited. A dual approach is planned. On
the one hand, the relatively conventional approach of improving
coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-ice models will be pursued. Ingenuity
aside, the computational demands are extreme, as is borne out by the
Earth System Simulator — 640 linked supercomputers providing 40
teraflops [<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{12}\)</span> floating-point operations per second] and a
cooling system from hell under one roof — to be built in Japan by
2003.— Newton, 1999.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Because models must be simplified to run on existing computers, the
models must be simpler than models that simulate flow for a few years
(<span class="smallcaps">wcrp</span>, 1995).</p>
<p>In addition, the coupled model must be integrated for many years for the
ocean and atmosphere to approach equilibrium. As the integration
proceeds, the coupled system tends to drift away from reality due to
errors in calculating fluxes of heat and momentum between the ocean and
atmosphere. For example, very small errors in precipitation over the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current leads to small changes the salinity of the
current, which leads to large changes in deep convection in the Weddell
Sea, which greatly influences the volume of deep water masses.</p>
<p>Some modelers allow the system to drift, others adjust sea-surface
temperature and the calculated fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere.
Returning to the example, the flux of fresh water in the circumpolar
current could be adjusted to keep salinity close to the observed value
in the current. There is no good scientific basis for the adjustments
except the desire to produce a “good” coupled model. Hence, the
adjustments are ad hoc and controversial. Such adjustments are called
<em>flux adjustments</em> or <em>flux corrections</em>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as models have improved, the need for adjustment or the
magnitude of the adjustment has been reduced. For example, using the
Gent-McWilliams scheme for mixing along constant-density surfaces in a
coupled ocean-atmosphere model greatly reduced climate drift in a
coupled ocean-atmosphere model because the mixing scheme reduced deep
convection in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and elsewhere (Hirst,
O’Farrell, and Gordon, 2000).</p>
<p>Grassl (2000) lists four capabilities of a credible coupled general
circulation model:</p>
<p>“Adequate representation of the present climate.</p>
<p>“Reproduction (within typical interannual and decades time-scale climate
variability) of the changes since the start of the instrumental record
for a given history of external forcing;</p>
<p>“Reproduction of a different climate episode in the past as derived from
paleoclimate records for given estimates of the history of external
forcing; and</p>
<p>“Successful simulation of the gross features of an abrupt climate change
event from the past.”</p>
<p>McAvaney et al. (2001) compared the oceanic component of twenty-four
coupled models, including models with and without flux adjustments. They
found substantial differences among the models. For example, only five
models calculated a meridional overturning circulation within 10% the
observed value of 20 Sv. Some had values as low as 3 Sv, others had
values as large as 36 Sv. Most models could not calculate a realistic
transport for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</p>
<p>Grassl (2000) found that many coupled climate models, including models
with and without flux adjustment, meet the first criterion. Some models
meet the second criterion (Smith et al. 2002, Stott et al. 2000), but
external solar forcing is still not well known and more work is needed.
And a few models are starting to reproduce some aspects of the warm
event of 6,000 years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But how useful are these models in making projections of future
climate? Opinion is polarized. At one extreme are those who take the
model results as gospel. At the other are those who denigrate results
simply because they distrust models, or on the grounds that the model
performance is obviously wrong in some respects or that a process is
not adequately included. The truth lies in between. All models are of
course wrong because, by design, they give a simplified view of the
system being modelled. Nevertheless, many—but not all—models are
very useful.—Trenberth, 1997.</p>
