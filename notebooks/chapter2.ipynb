    "Our knowledge of oceanic currents, winds, waves, and tides goes back\n",

    "others. They laid the foundation for global trade routes stretching\n",
    "from Spain to the Philippines in the early 16th century. The routes\n",
    "were based on a good working knowledge of trade winds, the westerlies,\n",
    "and western boundary currents in the Atlantic and Pacific (Couper,\n",
