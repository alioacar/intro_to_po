    "## The Role of Observations in Oceanography\n",
    "\n",
    "The brief tour of theoretical ideas suggests that observations are\n",
    "essential for understanding the ocean. The theory describing a\n",
    "convecting, wind-forced, turbulent fluid in a rotating coordinate system\n",
    "has never been sufficiently well known that important features of the\n",
    "oceanic circulation could be predicted before they were observed. In\n",
    "almost all cases, oceanographers resort to observations to understand\n",
    "oceanic processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, we might think that the numerous expeditions mounted\n",
    "since 1873 would give a good description of the ocean. The results are\n",
    "indeed impressive. Hundreds of expeditions have extended into all ocean.\n",
    "Yet, much of the ocean is poorly explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the year 2000, most areas of the ocean will have been sampled from\n",
    "top to bottom only once. Some areas, such as the Atlantic, will have\n",
    "been sparsely sampled three times: during the International Geophysical\n",
    "Year in 1959, during the Geochemical Sections cruises in the early\n",
    "1970s, and during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment from 1991 to\n",
    "1996. All areas will be vastly under sampled. This is the sampling\n",
    "problem ({ref}`Sampling Error<sampling_error>`). Our samples of the ocean are\n",
    "insufficient to describe the ocean well enough to predict its\n",
    "variability and its response to changing forcing. *Lack of sufficient\n",
    "samples is the largest source of error in our understanding of the\n",
    "ocean.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of observations has led to a very important and widespread\n",
    "conceptual error:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“The absence of evidence was taken as evidence of absence.”* The\n",
    "> great difficulty of observing the ocean meant that when a phenomenon\n",
    "> was not observed, it was assumed it was not present. The more one is\n",
    "> able to observe the ocean, the more the complexity and subtlety that\n",
    "> appears - {cite:p}`wunsch2002ocean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, our understanding of the ocean is often too simple to be\n",
    "correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Selecting Oceanic Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the existing oceanic data have been organized into large data\n",
    "sets. For example, satellite data are processed and distributed by\n",
    "groups working with <span class=\"smallcaps\">nasa</span>. Data from ships have been\n",
    "collected and organized by other groups. Oceanographers now rely more\n",
    "and more on such collections of data produced by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of data produced by others introduces problems: i) How accurate\n",
    "are the data in the set? ii) What are the limitations of the data set?\n",
    "And, iii) How does the set compare with other similar sets? Anyone who\n",
    "uses public or private data sets is wise to obtain answers to such\n",
    "questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to use data from others, here are some guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use well documented data sets*. Does the documentation completely\n",
    "describe the sources of the original measurements, all steps used to\n",
    "process the data, and all criteria used to exclude data? Does the data\n",
    "set include version numbers to identify changes to the set?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use validated data*. Has accuracy of data been well documented? Was\n",
    "accuracy determined by comparing with different measurements of the same\n",
    "variable? Was validation global or regional?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use sets that have been used by others and referenced in scientific\n",
    "papers*. Some data sets are widely used for good reason. Those who\n",
    "produced the sets used them in their own published work and others trust\n",
    "the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conversely, don’t use a data set just because it is handy*. Can you\n",
    "document the source of the set? For example, many versions of the\n",
    "digital, 5-minute maps of the sea floor are widely available. Some date\n",
    "back to the first sets produced by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency,\n",
    "others are from the <span class=\"smallcaps\">etopo-5</span> set. Don’t rely on a\n",
    "colleague’s statement about the source. Find the documentation. If it is\n",
    "missing, find another data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Designing Oceanic Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations are exceedingly important for oceanography, yet\n",
    "observations are expensive because ship time and satellites are\n",
    "expensive. As a result, oceanographic experiments must be carefully\n",
    "planned. While the design of experiments may not fit well within an\n",
    "historical chapter, perhaps the topic merits a few brief comments\n",
    "because it is seldom mentioned in oceanographic textbooks, although it\n",
    "is prominently described in texts for other scientific fields. The\n",
    "design of experiments is particularly important because poorly planned\n",
    "experiments lead to ambiguous results, they may measure the wrong\n",
    "variables, or they may produce completely useless data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Sampling Error\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    ":name: sampling_error\n",
    "Sampling error is the largest source of error in the geosciences. It\n",
    "is caused by a set of samples not representing the population of the\n",
    "variable being measured. A population is the set of all possible\n",
    "measurements, and a sample is the sampled subset of the population. We\n",
    "assume each measurement is perfectly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if your measurement has a sampling error,\n",
    "you must first completely specify the problem you wish to study. This\n",
    "defines the population. Then, you must determine if the samples\n",
    "represent the population.  Both steps are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your problem is to measure the annual-mean\n",
    "sea-surface temperature of the ocean to determine if global warming is\n",
    "occurring. For this problem, the population is the set of all possible\n",
    "measurements of surface temperature, in all regions in all months. If\n",
    "the sample mean is to equal the true mean, the samples must be\n",
    "uniformly distributed throughout the year and over all the area of the\n",
    "ocean, and sufficiently dense to include all important variability in\n",
    "time and space. This is impossible. Ships avoid stormy regions such as\n",
    "high latitudes in winter, so ship samples tend not to represent the\n",
    "population of surface temperatures. Satellites may not sample\n",
    "uniformly throughout the daily cycle, and they may not observe\n",
    "temperature at high latitudes in winter because of persistent clouds,\n",
    "although they tend to sample uniformly in space and throughout the\n",
    "year in most regions. If daily variability is small, the satellite\n",
    "samples will be more representative of the population than the ship\n",
    "samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, it should be clear that oceanic samples\n",
    "rarely represent the population we wish to study. We always have\n",
    "sampling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In defining sampling error, we must clearly distinguish\n",
    "between instrument errors and sampling errors. Instrument errors are\n",
    "due to the inaccuracy of the instrument. Sampling errors are due to a\n",
    "failure to make a measurement. Consider the example above: the\n",
    "determination of mean sea-surface temperature. If the measurements are\n",
    "made by thermometers on ships, each measurement has a small error\n",
    "because thermometers are not perfect. This is an instrument error. If\n",
    "the ships avoids high latitudes in winter, the absence of measurements\n",
    "at high latitude in winter is a sampling error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meteorologists designing the Tropical Rainfall Mapping\n",
    "Mission have been investigating the sampling error in measurements of\n",
    "rain. Their results are general and may be applied to other\n",
    "variables. For a general description of the problem see {cite:p}`north1989`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important aspect of the design of any experiment is\n",
    "to determine *why* you wish to make a measurement before deciding how\n",
    "you will make the measurement or what you will measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the purpose of the observations? Do you wish to test hypotheses\n",
    "or describe processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "What accuracy is required of the observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "What resolution in time and space is required? What is the duration of\n",
    "measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, how the purpose of the measurement changes how\n",
    "you might measure salinity or temperature as a function of depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the purpose is to describe water masses in an ocean basin, then\n",
    "measurements with 20–50 m vertical spacing and 50–300 km horizontal\n",
    "spacing, repeated once per 20–50 years in deep water are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the purpose is to describe vertical mixing in the open equatorial\n",
    "Pacific, then 0.5–1.0 mm vertical spacing and 50–1000 km spacing\n",
    "between locations repeated once per hour for many days may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Accuracy, Precision, and Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are on the topic of experiments, now is a good time to\n",
    "introduce three concepts needed throughout the book when we discuss\n",
    "experiments: precision, accuracy, and linearity of a measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Accuracy* is the difference between the measured value and the true\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Precision* is the difference among repeated measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between accuracy and precision is usually illustrated by\n",
    "the simple example of firing a rifle at a target. Accuracy is the\n",
    "average distance from the center of the target to the hits on the\n",
    "target. Precision is the average distance between the hits. Thus, ten\n",
    "rifle shots could be clustered within a circle 10 cm in diameter with\n",
    "the center of the cluster located 20 cm from the center of the target.\n",
    "The accuracy is then 20 cm, and the precision is roughly 5 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linearity** requires that the output of an instrument be a linear function of the input. Nonlinear devices rectify variability to a constant value, so a non-linear response leads to incorrect mean values. Non-linearity can be as important as accuracy. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Output} &= \\text{Input} + 0.1(\\text{Input})^2, \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Input} &= a \\sin \\omega t.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Output} &= a \\sin \\omega t + 0.1(a \\sin \\omega t)^2, \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Output} &= \\text{Input} + \\frac{0.1}{2} a^2 - \\frac{0.1}{2} a^2 \\cos 2\\omega t.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the mean value of the input is zero, yet the output of this non-linear instrument has a mean value of ($ 0.05 a^2 $) plus an equally large term at twice the input frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if the **input** has frequencies ($\\omega_1$) and ($\\omega_2$), then the **output** of a non-linear instrument contains frequencies ($\\omega_1 \\pm \\omega_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity of an instrument is especially important when the instrument must measure the mean value of a turbulent variable. For example, linear current meters are required when measuring currents near the sea surface, where wind and waves produce large variability in the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sensitivity to other variables of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors may be correlated with other variables of the problem. For\n",
    "example, measurements of conductivity are sensitive to temperature. So,\n",
    "errors in the measurement of temperature in salinometers leads to errors\n",
    "in the measured values of conductivity or salinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, I hope you have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean is not well known. What we know is based on data collected\n",
    "from only a little more than a century of oceanographic expeditions\n",
    "supplemented with satellite data collected since 1978.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic description of the ocean is sufficient for describing the\n",
    "time-averaged mean circulation of the ocean, and recent work is\n",
    "beginning to describe the variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations are essential for understanding the ocean. Few processes\n",
    "have been predicted from theory before they were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of observations has led to conceptual pictures of oceanic processes\n",
    "that are often too simplified and often misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oceanographers rely more and more on large data sets produced by others.\n",
    "The sets have errors and limitations which you must understand before\n",
    "using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning of experiments is at least as important as conducting the\n",
    "experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling errors arise when the observations, the samples, are not\n",
    "representative of the process being studied. Sampling errors are the\n",
    "largest source of error in oceanography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all our observations of the ocean now come from satellites,\n",
    "drifters, and autonomous instruments. Fewer and fewer observations come\n",
    "from ships at sea."
