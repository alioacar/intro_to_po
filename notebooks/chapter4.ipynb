    "\n",
    "The sun and the atmosphere drive directly or indirectly almost all\n",
    "dynamical processes in the ocean. The dominant external sources and\n",
    "sinks of energy are sunlight, evaporation, infrared emissions from the\n",
    "sea surface, and sensible heating of the sea by warm or cold winds.\n",
    "Winds drive the ocean’s surface circulation down to depths of around a\n",
    "kilometer. Wind and tidal mixing drive the deeper currents in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean, in turn, is the dominant source of heat that drives the\n",
    "atmospheric circulation. The uneven distribution of heat loss and gain\n",
    "by the ocean leads to winds in the atmosphere. Sunlight warms the\n",
    "tropical ocean, which evaporate, transferring heat in the form of water\n",
    "vapor to the atmosphere. The heat is released when the vapor condenses\n",
    "as rain. Winds and ocean currents carry heat poleward, where it is lost\n",
    "to space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the atmosphere drives the ocean, and the ocean drives the\n",
    "atmosphere, we must consider the ocean and the atmosphere as a coupled\n",
    "dynamic system. In this chapter we will look mainly at the exchange of\n",
    "momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean. In the next chapter, we\n",
    "will look at heat exchanges. In chapter 14 we will look at how the ocean\n",
    "and the atmosphere interact in the Pacific to produce El Niño.\n",

    "## The Earth in Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth’s orbit about the sun is nearly circular at a mean distance of\n",
    "$1.5 \\times 10^8$ km. The eccentricity of the orbit is small, 0.0168.\n",
    "Thus earth is 3.4% further from the Sun at aphelion than at perihelion,\n",
    "the time of closest approach to the sun. Perihelion occurs every year in\n",
    "January, and the exact time changes by about 20 minutes per year. In\n",
    "1995, it occurred on 3 January. Earth’s axis of rotation is inclined\n",
    "23.45 to the plane of earth’s orbit around the sun (figure 4.1). The\n",
    "orientation is such that the sun is directly overhead at the Equator on\n",
    "the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, which occur on or about 21 March and\n",
    "21 September each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latitudes of 23.45 North and South are the Tropics of Cancer and\n",
    "Capricorn respectively. The tropics lie equatorward of these latitudes.\n",
    "As a result of the eccentricity of earth’s orbit, maximum solar\n",
    "insolation averaged over the surface of the earth occurs in early\n",
    "January each year. As a result of the inclination of earth’s axis of\n",
    "rotation, the maximum insolation at any location outside the tropics\n",
    "occurs around 21 June in the northern hemisphere, and around 21 December\n",
    "in the southern hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4.1 The earth in space. The\n",
    "\n",

    "between 40 to 60 latitude, the roaring forties, weak winds in the\n",

    "shows that the surface winds are influenced by equatorial convection and\n",

    "Pacific are about 8 m/s. <span id=\"fig:seasonalwinds\" label=\"fig:seasonalwinds\"></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps of surface winds change somewhat with the seasons. The largest\n",
    "changes are in the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean (figure\n",
    "4.4). Both regions are strongly influenced by the Asian monsoon. In\n",
    "winter, the cold air mass over Siberia creates a region of high pressure\n",
    "at the surface, and cold air blows southeastward across Japan and on\n",
    "across the hot Kuroshio, extracting heat from the ocean. In summer, the\n",
    "thermal low over Tibet draws warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean\n",
    "leading to the rainy season over India.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Planetary Boundary Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmosphere within 100 m of the sea surface is influenced by the\n",
    "turbulent drag of the wind on the sea and the fluxes of heat through the\n",
    "surface. This is the *atmospheric boundary layer*. It’s thickness $Z_i$\n",
    "varies from a few tens of meters for weak winds blowing over water\n",
    "colder than the air to around a kilometer for stronger winds blowing\n",
    "over water warmer than the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest part of the atmospheric boundary layer is the surface layer.\n",
    "Within this layer, which has thickness of $\\approx 0.1 Z_i$, vertical\n",
    "fluxes of heat and momentum are nearly constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind speed varies as the logarithm of height within the surface layer\n",
    "for neutral stability. See “The Turbulent Boundary Layer Over a Flat\n",
    "Plate” in Chapter 8. Hence, the height of a wind measurement is\n",
    "important. Usually, winds are reported as the value of wind at a height\n",
    "10 m above the sea $U_{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurement of Wind\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind at sea has been measured for centuries. Maury (1855) was the first\n",
    "to systematically collect and map wind reports. Recently, the US\n",
    "National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration <span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> has\n",
    "collected, edited, and digitized millions of observations going back\n",
    "over a century. The resulting *International Comprehensive Ocean,\n",
    "Atmosphere Data Set* <span class=\"smallcaps\">icoads</span> discussed in §5.5 is widely\n",
    "used for studying atmospheric forcing of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our knowledge of winds at the sea surface come from many sources. Here\n",
    "are the more important, listed in a crude order of relative importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Beaufort Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "By far the most common source of wind data up to 1991 have been reports\n",
    "of speed based on the Beaufort scale. The scale is based on features,\n",
    "such as foam coverage and wave shape, seen by an observer on a ship\n",
    "(table 4.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale was originally proposed by Admiral Sir F. Beaufort in 1806 to\n",
    "give the force of the wind on a ship’s sails. It was adopted by the\n",
    "British Admiralty in 1838 and it soon came into general use.\n",

    "\n",
    "The International Meteorological Committee adopted the force scale for\n",
    "international use in 1874. In 1926 they adopted a revised scale giving\n",
    "the wind speed at a height of 6 meters corresponding to the Beaufort\n",
    "Number. The scale was revised again in 1946 to extend the scale to\n",
    "higher wind speeds and to give the equivalent wind speed at a height of\n",
    "10 meters. The 1946 scale was based on the equation $U_{10} = 0.836 B^{3/2}$, where $B =$ Beaufort Number and $U_{10}$ is the wind speed in\n",
    "meters per second at a height of 10 meters (List, 1966). More recently,\n",
    "various groups have revised the Beaufort scale by comparing Beaufort\n",
    "force with ship measurements of winds. Kent and Taylor (1997) compared\n",
    "the various revisions of the scale with winds measured by ships having\n",

    "a radar that measures the scatter of centimeter-wavelength radio waves\n",

    "scatterometer on <span class=\"smallcaps\">adeos</span> measured winds for a six-month\n",
    "period beginning November 1996 and ending with the premature failure of\n",
    "the satellite. It was replaced by another scatterometer on QuikScat,\n",
    "launched on 19 June 1999. Quikscat views 93% of the ocean every 24 hr\n",
    "with a resolution of 25 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freilich and Dunbar (1999) report that, overall, the <span class=\"smallcaps\">nasa</span>\n",
    "scatterometer on <span class=\"smallcaps\">adeos</span> measured wind speed with an\n",
    "accuracy of $\\pm 1.3$ m/s. The error in wind direction was $\\pm17$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Windsat is an experimental, polarimetric, microwave radiometer developed\n",
    "by the US Navy that measures the amount and polarization of microwave\n",

    "the vertical and at five radio frequencies. It was launched on 6 January\n",
    "2003 on the Coriolis satellite. The received radio signal is a function\n",
    "of wind speed, sea-surface temperature, water vapor in the atmosphere,\n",
    "rain rate, and the amount of water in cloud drops. By observing several\n",
    "frequencies simultaneously, data from the instrument are used for\n",
    "calculating the surface wind speed and direction, sea-surface\n",
    "temperature, total precipitable water, integrated cloud liquid water,\n",
    "and rain rate over the ocean regardless of time of day or cloudiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winds are calculated over most of the ocean on a 25-km grid once a day.\n",
    "Winds measured by Windsat have an accuracy of $\\pm 2$ m/s in speed and\n",
    "$\\pm 20$ in direction over the range of 5–25 m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Special Sensor Microwave SSM/I\n",
    "\n",
    "Another satellite instrument that is used to measure wind speed is the\n",
    "Special-Sensor Microwave/Imager (<span class=\"smallcaps\">ssm/i</span>) carried since 1987\n",
    "on the satellites of the U.S. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program\n",
    "in orbits similar to the <span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> polar-orbiting\n",
    "meteorological satellites. The instrument measures the microwave\n",
    "radiation emitted from the sea at an angle near 60 from the vertical.\n",
    "The radio signal is a function of wind speed, water vapor in the\n",
    "atmosphere, and the amount of water in cloud drops. By observing several\n",
    "frequencies simultaneously, data from the instrument are used for\n",
    "calculating the surface wind speed, water vapor, cloud water, and rain\n",
    "rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Winds measured by <span class=\"smallcaps\">ssm/i</span> have an accuracy of $\\pm$ 2 m/s in\n",
    "speed. When combined with <span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> 1000 mb wind analyses,\n",
    "wind direction can be calculated with an accuracy of $\\pm 22$ (Atlas,\n",
    "Hoffman, and Bloom, 1993). Global, gridded data are available since July\n",
    "1987 on a 0.25 grid every 6 hours. But remember, the instrument views a\n",
    "specific oceanic area only once a day, and the gridded, 6-hourly maps\n",
    "have big gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Anemometers on Ships\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite observations are supplemented by winds reported to\n",
    "meteorological agencies by observers reading anemometers on ships. The\n",
    "anemometer is read four times a day at the standard Greenwich times and\n",
    "reported via radio to meteorological agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the biggest error is the sampling error. Very few ships carry\n",
    "calibrated anemometers. Those that do tend to be commercial ships\n",
    "participating in the Volunteer Observing Ship program (figure 4.5).\n",
    "These ships are met in port by scientists who check the instruments and\n",
    "replace them if necessary, and who collect the data measured at sea. The\n",
    "accuracy of wind measurements from these ships is about $\\pm 2$ m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calibrated Anemometers on Weather Buoys\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate measurements of winds at sea are made by calibrated\n",
    "anemometers on moored weather buoys. Unfortunately there are few such\n",
    "buoys, perhaps only a hundred scattered around the world. Some, such as\n",
    "Tropical Atmosphere Ocean <span class=\"smallcaps\">tao</span> array in the tropical\n",
    "Pacific (figure 14.14) provide data from remote areas rarely visited by\n",
    "ships, but most tend to be located just offshore of coastal areas.\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> operates buoys offshore of the United States and the\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">tao</span> array in the Pacific. Data from the coastal buoys are\n",
    "averaged for eight minutes before the hour, and the observations are\n",
    "transmitted to shore via satellite links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best accuracy of anemometers on buoys operated by the\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">us</span> National Data Buoy Center is the greater of\n",
    "$\\pm$<!-- -->1 m/s or 10% for wind speed and $\\pm 10$ for wind\n",
    "direction (Beardsley et al. 1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculations of Wind\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellites, ships, and buoys measure winds at various locations and\n",
    "times of the day. If you wish to use the observations to calculate\n",
    "monthly averaged winds over the sea, then the observations can be\n",
    "averaged and gridded. If you wish to use wind data in numerical models\n",
    "of the ocean’s currents, then the data will be less useful. You are\n",
    "faced with a very common problem: How to take all observations made in a\n",
    "six-hour period and determine the winds over the ocean on a fixed grid?\n",
    "\n",
    "One source of gridded winds over the ocean is the *surface analysis*\n",
    "calculated by numerical weather models. The strategy used to produce the\n",
    "six-hourly gridded winds is called *sequential estimation techniques* or\n",
    "*data assimilation*. “Measurements are used to prepare initial\n",
    "conditions for the model, which is then integrated forward in time until\n",
    "further measurements are available. The model is thereupon\n",
    "re-initialized” (Bennett, 1992: 67). The initial condition is called the\n",
    "*analysis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, all available measurements are used in the analysis, including\n",
    "observations from weather stations on land, pressure and temperature\n",
    "reported by ships and buoys, winds from scatterometers in space, and\n",
    "data from meteorological satellites. The model interpolates the\n",
    "measurements to produce an analysis consistent with previous and present\n",
    "observations. Daley (1991) describes the techniques in considerable\n",
    "detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Surface Analysis from Numerical Weather Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most widely used weather model is that run by the European\n",
    "Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts <span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span>. It\n",
    "calculates a surface analysis, including surface winds and heat fluxes\n",
    "(see Chapter 5) every six hours on a 1 $\\times$ 1 grid from an explicit\n",
    "boundary-layer model. Calculated values are archived on a 2.5 grid. Thus\n",
    "the wind maps from the numerical weather models lack the detail seen in\n",
    "maps from scatterometer data, which have a 1/4 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> calculations of winds have relatively good accuracy.\n",
    "Freilich and Dunbar (1999) estimated that the accuracy for wind speed at\n",
    "10 meters is $\\pm 1.5$ m/s, and $\\pm 18$ for direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy in the southern hemisphere is probably as good as in the\n",
    "northern hemisphere because continents do not disrupt the flow as much\n",
    "as in the northern hemisphere, and because scatterometers give accurate\n",
    "positions of storms and fronts over the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <span class=\"smallcaps\">noaa</span> National Centers for Environmental Prediction and\n",
    "the US Navy also produces global analyses and forecasts every six hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reanalyzed Data from Numerical Weather Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface analyses of weather over some regions have been produced for\n",
    "more than a hundred years, and over the whole earth since about 1950.\n",
    "Surface analyses calculated by numerical models of the atmospheric\n",
    "circulation have been available for decades. Throughout this period, the\n",
    "methods for calculating surface analyses have constantly changed as\n",
    "meteorologists worked to make ever more accurate forecasts. Fluxes\n",
    "calculated from the analyses are therefore not consistent in time. The\n",
    "changes can be larger than the interannual variability of the fluxes\n",
    "(White, 1996). To minimize this problem, meteorological agencies have\n",
    "taken all archived weather data and reanalyzed them using the best\n",
    "numerical models to produce a uniform, internally-consistent, surface\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reanalyzed data are used to study oceanic and atmospheric processes\n",
    "in the past. Surface analyses issued every six hours from weather\n",
    "agencies are used only for problems that require up-to-date information.\n",
    "For example, if you are designing an offshore structure, you will\n",
    "probably use decades of reanalyzed data. If you are operating an\n",
    "offshore structure, you will watch the surface analysis and forecasts\n",
    "put out every six hours by meteorological agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sources of Reanalyzed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Reanalyzed surface flux data are available from national meteorological\n",
    "centers operating numerical weather prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. National Centers for Environmental Predictions, working with\n",
    "the National Center for Atmospheric Research have produced the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ncep/\n",
    "ncar</span> reanalysis based on 51 years of weather data from 1948\n",
    "to 2005 using the 25 January 1995 version of their forecast model. The\n",
    "reanalysis period is being extended forward to include all date up to\n",
    "the present with about a three-day delay in producing data sets. The\n",
    "reanalysis uses surface and ship observations plus sounder data from\n",
    "satellites. Reanalysis products are available every six hours on a T62\n",
    "grid having $192 \\times 94$ grid points with a spatial resolution of 209\n",
    "km and with 28 vertical levels. Important subsets of the reanalysis,\n",
    "including surface fluxes, are available on <span class=\"smallcaps\">cd–rom</span> (Kalnay\n",
    "et al. 1996; Kistler et al. 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">ecmwf</span> has reanalyzed 45 years of weather data from\n",
    "September 1957 to August 2002 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">era</span>-40) using their\n",
    "forecast model of 2001 (Uppala et al. 2005). The reanalysis uses mostly\n",
    "the same surface and ship data used by the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ncep/ncar</span>\n",
    "reanalysis plus data from the <span class=\"smallcaps\">ers</span>-1 and\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">ers</span>-2 satellites and <span class=\"smallcaps\">ssm/i</span>. The\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">era</span>-40 full-resolution products are available every six\n",
    "hours on a N80 grid having $160 \\times 320$ grid points with a spatial\n",
    "resolution of 1.125 and with 60 vertical levels. The\n",
    "<span class=\"smallcaps\">era</span>-40 basic-resolution products are available every six\n",
    "hours with a spatial resolution of 2.5 and with 23 vertical levels. The\n",
    "reanalysis includes an ocean-wave model that calculates ocean wave\n",
    "heights and wave spectra every six hours on a 1.5 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wind Stress\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind, by itself, is usually not very interesting. Often we are much\n",
    "more interested in the force of the wind, or the work done by the wind.\n",
    "The horizontal force of the wind on the sea surface is called the *wind\n",
    "stress*. Put another way, it is the vertical transfer of horizontal\n",
    "momentum. Thus momentum is transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean\n",
    "by wind stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind stress $T$ is calculated from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = \\rho_a \\,C_D U_{10}^2$$ where $\\rho_a = 1.3$ kg/m$^3$ is the\n",
    "density of air, $U_{10}$ is wind speed at 10 meters, and $C_D$ is the\n",
    "*drag coefficient*. $C_D$ is measured using the techniques described in\n",
    "§5.6. Fast response instruments measure wind fluctuations within 10–20\n",
    "m of the sea surface, from which $T$ is directly calculated. The\n",
    "correlation of $T$ with $U_{10}^2$ gives $C_D$ (figure 4.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Various measurements of $C_D$ have been published based on careful\n",
    "measurements of turbulence in the marine boundary layer. Trenberth et\n",
    "al. (1989) and Harrison (1989) discuss the accuracy of an effective drag\n",
    "coefficient relating wind stress to wind velocity on a global scale.\n",
    "Perhaps the best of the recently published values are those of Yelland\n",
    "and Taylor (1996) and Yelland et al. (1998) who give:\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Sunlight is the primary energy source driving the atmosphere and\n",
    "    ocean. There is a boundary layer at the bottom of the atmosphere\n",
    "    where wind speed decreases with as the boundary is approached, and\n",
    "    in which fluxes of heat and momentum are constant in the lower\n",
    "    10–20 meters. Wind is measured many different ways. The most common\n",
    "    until 1995 was from observations made at sea of the Beaufort force\n",
    "    of the wind. Since 1995, the most important source of wind\n",
    "    measurements is from scatterometers on satellites. They produce\n",
    "    daily global maps with 25 km resolution. The surface analysis from\n",
    "    numerical models of the atmosphere is the most useful source of\n",
    "    global, gridded maps of wind velocity for dates before 1995. It also\n",
    "    is a useful source for 6-hourly maps. Resolution is 100-250 km. The\n",
    "    flux of momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean, the wind stress,\n",
    "    is calculated from wind speed using a drag coefficient."
