<h1><span class="section-number">14. </span>Equatorial Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-processes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Equatorial processes are at the center of our understanding the
influence of the ocean on the atmosphere, and they dominate the
interannual fluctuations in global weather patterns. The sun warms the
vast expanses of the tropical Pacific and Indian ocean, evaporating
water. When the water condenses as rain it releases so much heat that
these areas are the primary engine driving the atmospheric circulation
(figure 14.1). Rainfall over extensive areas exceeds three meters per
year (figure 5.5), and some oceanic regions receive more than five
meters of rain per year. To put the numbers in perspective, five meters
of rain per year releases on average 400 W/m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^2\)</span> of heat to the
atmosphere. Equatorial currents modulate the air-sea interactions,
especially through the phenomenon known as El Niño, with global
consequences. I describe here first the basic equatorial processes, then
the year-to-year variability of the processes and the influence of the
variability on weather patterns.</p>
<p>Figure 14.1 Average diabatic</p>
<p>heating between 700 and 50 mb in the atmosphere during December, January
and February calculated from <span class="smallcaps">ecmwf</span> data for 1983–1989.
Most of the heating is due to the release of latent heat by rain. After
Webster et al. (1992). <span id="fig:rainheat" label="fig:rainheat"></span></p>
<section id="id1">
<h2><span class="section-number">14.1. </span>Equatorial Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The tropical ocean is characterized by a thin, permanent, shallow layer
of warm water over deeper, colder water. In this respect, the vertical
stratification is similar to the summer stratification at higher
latitudes. Surface waters are hottest in the west (figure 6.3) in the
great Pacific warm pool. The mixed layer is deep in the west and very
shallow in the east (Figure 14.2).</p>
<p>Figure 14.2 The mean,</p>
<p>upper-ocean, thermal structure along the equator in the Pacific from
north of New Guinea to Ecuador calculated from data in Levitus (1982).</p>
<p><span id="fig:equator" label="fig:equator"></span></p>
<p>The shallow thermocline has important consequences. The southeast trade
winds blow along the equator (figure 4.2) although they tend to be
strongest in the east. North of the equator, Ekman transport is
northward. South of the equator it is southward. The divergence of the
Ekman flow causes upwelling on the equator. In the west, the upwelled
water is warm. But in the east the upwelled water is cold because the
thermocline is so shallow. This leads to a cold tongue of water at the
sea surface extending from South America to near the dateline (figure
6.3).</p>
<p>Surface temperature in the east is a balance among four processes:</p>
<p>The strength of the upwelling, which is determined by the westward
component of the wind.</p>
<p>The speed of westward currents which carry cold water from the coast of
Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>North-south mixing with warmer waters on either side of the equator.</p>
<p>Heat fluxes through the sea surface along the equator.</p>
<p>The east-west temperature gradient on the equator drives a zonal
circulation in the atmosphere, the Walker circulation. Thunderstorms
over the warm pool carry air upward, and sinking air in the east feeds
the return flow at the surface. Variations in the temperature gradient
influences the Walker circulation, which, in turn, influences the
gradient. The feedback can lead to an instability, the El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (<span class="smallcaps">enso</span>) discussed in the next section.</p>
<section id="surface-currents">
<h3><span class="section-number">14.1.1. </span>Surface Currents<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-currents" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The strong stratification confines the wind-driven circulation to the
mixed layer and upper thermocline. Sverdrup’s theory and Munk’s
extension, described in §11.1 and §11.3, explain the surface currents in
the tropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian ocean. The currents include
(figure 14.3):</p>
<p>Figure 14.3 Average currents at 10 m</p>
<p>calculated from the Modular Ocean Model driven by observed winds and
mean heat fluxes from 1981 to 1994. The model, operated by the
<span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> National Centers for Environmental Prediction,
assimilates observed surface and subsurface temperatures. After
Behringer, Ji, and Leetmaa (1998). <span id="fig:EqCurr" label="fig:EqCurr"></span></p>
<p>The North Equatorial Countercurrent between 3N and 10N, which flows
eastward with a typical surface speed of 50 cm/s. The current is
centered on the band of weak winds, the <em>doldrums</em>, around 5–10N where
the north and south trade winds converge, the <em>tropical convergence
zone</em>.</p>
<p>The North and South Equatorial Currents which flow westward in the zonal
band on either side of the countercurrent. The currents are shallow,
less than 200 m deep. The northern current is weak, with a speed less
than roughly 20 cm/s. The southern current has a maximum speed of around
100 cm/s, in the band between 3N and the equator.</p>
<p>The currents in the Atlantic are similar to those in the Pacific because
the trade winds in that ocean also converge near 5 –10N. The South
Equatorial Current in the Atlantic continues northwest along the coast
of Brazil, where it is known as the North Brazil Current. In the Indian
Ocean, the doldrums occur in the southern hemisphere and only during the
northern-hemisphere winter. In the northern hemisphere, the currents
reverse with the monsoon winds.</p>
<p>There is, however, much more to the story of equatorial currents.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">14.1.2. </span>Equatorial Undercurrent: Observations<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-undercurrent-observations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Just a few meters below the surface on the equator is a strong eastward
flowing current, the Equatorial Undercurrent, the last major oceanic
current to be discovered. Here’s the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In September 1951, aboard the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research
vessel long-line fishing on the equator south of Hawaii, it was
noticed that the subsurface gear drifted steadily to the east. The
next year Cromwell, in company with Montgomery and Stroup, led an
expedition to investigate the vertical distribution of horizontal
velocity at the equator. Using floating drogues at the surface and at
various depths, they were able to establish the presence, near the
equator in the central Pacific, of a strong, narrow eastward current
in the lower part of the surface layer and the upper part of the
thermocline (Cromwell, <em>et. al.</em>, 1954). A few years later the Scripps
<em>Eastropac</em> Expedition, under Cromwell’s leadership, found the current
extended toward the east nearly to the Galapagos Islands but was not
present between those islands and the South American continent.</p>
<p>The current is remarkable in that, even though comparable in transport
to the Florida Current, its presence was unsuspected ten years ago.
Even now, neither the source nor the ultimate fate of its waters has
been established. No theory of oceanic circulation predicted its
existence, and only now are such theories being modified to account
for the important features of its flow.—Warren S. Wooster (1960).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Equatorial Undercurrent in the Atlantic was first discovered by
Buchanan in 1886, and in the Pacific by the Japanese Navy in the 1920s
and 1930s (McPhaden, 1986).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>However, no attention was paid to these observations. Other earlier
hints regarding this undercurrent were mentioned by Matthäus (1969).
Thus the old experience becomes even more obvious which says that
discoveries not attracting the attention of contemporaries simply do
not exist.—Dietrich et al. (1980).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Bob Arthur (1960) summarized the major aspects of the flow:</p>
<p>Surface flow may be directed westward at speeds of 25–75 cm/s;</p>
<p>Current reverses at a depth of from 20 to 40 m;</p>
<p>Eastward undercurrent extends to a depth of 400 meters with a transport
of as much as 30 Sv <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(=30 \times 10^6\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^3\)</span>/s;</p>
<p>Core of maximum eastward velocity (0.50–1.50 m/s) rises from a depth of
100 m at 140W to 40 m at 98W, then dips down;</p>
<p>Undercurrent appears to be symmetrical about the equator and becomes
much thinner and weaker at 2N and 2S.</p>
<p>In essence, the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent is a ribbon with
dimensions of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.2 \text{ km} \times 300 \text{ km} \times 13,000 \text{ km}\)</span> (figure 14.4).</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">14.1.3. </span>Equatorial Undercurrent: Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-undercurrent-theory" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Although we do not yet have a complete theory for the undercurrent, we
do have a clear understanding of some of the more important processes at
work in the equatorial regions. Pedlosky(1996), in his excellent chapter
on Equatorial Dynamics of the Thermocline: The Equatorial Undercurrent,
points out that the basic dynamical balances we have used in mid
latitudes break down near or on the equator.</p>
<p>Near the equator:</p>
<p>The Coriolis parameter becomes very small, going to zero at the equator:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=2\Omega \sin\varphi = \beta y \approx 2\Omega \,\varphi\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( where
\)</span>\varphi<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is latitude, \)</span>\beta = \partial f/\partial y \approx 2\Omega/R<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( near the equator, and \)</span>y=R,\varphi$.</p>
<p>Planetary vorticity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> is also small, and the advection of relative
vorticity cannot be neglected. Thus the Sverdrup balance (11.7) must be
modified.</p>
<p>The geostrophic and vorticity balances fail when the meridional distance
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> to the equator is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(O\left(\sqrt{U/\beta}\right)\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = \partial f / \partial y\)</span>. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U=1\)</span> m/s, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L=200\)</span> km or 2 of
latitude. Lagerloeff et al (1999), using measured currents, show that
currents near the equator can be described by the geostrophic balance
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|\varphi | &gt; 2.2^{\circ}\)</span>. They also show that flow closer to the
equator can be described using a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>-plane approximation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f = \beta y\)</span>.</p>
<p>The geostrophic balance for <em>zonal</em> currents works so well near the
equator because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial \zeta/\partial y \rightarrow 0\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\varphi \rightarrow 0\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> is sea surface
topography.</p>
<p>Upwelled water along the equator produced by Ekman pumping is not part
of a two-dimensional flow in a north-south, meridional plane. The flow
is three-dimensional. Water tends to flow along the contours of constant
density (isopycnal surfaces), close to the lines of constant temperature
in figure 14.2. Cold water enters the undercurrent in the far west
Pacific, and it moves eastward and upward along the equator. For
example, the 25isotherm enters the undercurrent at a depth near 125 m in
the western Pacific at 170E and eventually reaches the surface at 125W
in the eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>The meridional geostrophic balance near the equator gives the speed of
the zonal currents, but it does not explain what drives the
undercurrent. A very simplified theory for the undercurrent is based on
a balance of zonal pressure gradients along the equator. Wind stress
pushes water westward, producing the deep thermocline and warm pool in
the west. The deepening of the thermocline causes the sea-surface
topography <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\zeta\)</span> to be higher in the west, assuming that flow below
the thermocline is weak. Thus there is an eastward pressure gradient
along the equator in the surface layers to a depth of a few hundred
meters. The eastward pressure gradient at the surface (layer A in figure
14.5) is balanced by the wind stress <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_x\)</span>, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_x / H = -\partial p/\partial x\)</span>, where H is the mixed-layer depth</p>
<p>Below a few tens of meters in layer B, the influence of the wind stress
is small, and the pressure gradient is unbalanced, leading to an
accelerated flow toward the east, the equatorial undercurrent. Within
this layer, the flow accelerates until the pressure gradient is balanced
by frictional forces which tend to slow the current. At depths below a
few hundred meters in layer C, the eastward pressure gradient is too
weak to produce a current, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial p / \partial x \approx 0\)</span>.</p>

along the equator. <strong>Right:</strong> Eastward pressure gradient in the central
Pacific caused by the density structure at left. <span id="fig:equatorsketch" label="fig:equatorsketch"></span></p>
<p>Coriolis forces keep the equatorial undercurrent centered on the
equator. If the flow strays northward, the Coriolis force deflects the
current southward. The opposite occurs if the flow strays southward.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">14.2. </span>Variable Equatorial Circulation: El Niño/La Niña<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-equatorial-circulation-el-nino-la-nina" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The trades are remarkably steady, but they do vary from month to month
and year to year, especially in the western Pacific. One important
source of variability are Madden-Julian waves in the atmosphere
(McPhaden, 1999). If the trades in the west weaken or reverse, the
air-sea system in the equatorial regions can be thrown into another
state called El Niño. This disruption of the equatorial system in the
Pacific is the most important cause of changing weather patterns around
the globe.</p>
<p>Although the modern meaning of the term El Niño denotes a disruption of
the entire equatorial system in the Pacific, the term has been used in
the past to describe several very different processes. This causes a lot
of confusion. To reduce the confusion, let’s learn a little history.</p>
<section id="a-little-history">
<h3><span class="section-number">14.2.1. </span>A Little History<a class="headerlink" href="#a-little-history" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the 19th century, the term was applied to conditions off the coast of
Peru. The following quote comes from the introduction to Philander’s
(1990) excellent book <em>El Niño, La Niña, and the Southern Oscillation</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the year 1891, Señor Dr. Luis Carranza of the Lima Geographical
Society, contributed a small article to the Bulletin of that Society,
calling attention to the fact that a counter-current flowing from
north to south had been observed between the ports of Paita and
Pacasmayo.</p>
<p>The Paita sailors, who frequently navigate along the coast in small
craft, either to the north or the south of that port, name this
counter-current the current of “El Niño” (the Child Jesus) because it
has been observed to appear immediately after Christmas.</p>
<p>As this counter-current has been noticed on different occasions, and
its appearance along the Peruvian coast has been concurrent with rains
in latitudes where it seldom if ever rains to any great extent, I
wish, on the present occasion, to call the attention of the
distinguished geographers here assembled to this phenomenon, which
exercises, undoubtedly, a very great influence over the climatic
conditions of that part of the world.—Señor Frederico Alfonso
Pezet’s address to the Sixth International Geographical Congress in
Lima, Peru 1895.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Peruvians noticed that in some years the El Niño current was
stronger than normal, it penetrated further south, and it is associated
with heavy rains in Peru. This occurred in 1891 when (again quoting from
Philander’s book)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>…it was then seen that, whereas nearly every summer here and there
there is a trace of the current along the coast, in that year it was
so visible, and its effects were so palpable by the fact that large
dead alligators and trunks of trees were borne down to Pacasmayo from
the north, and that the whole temperature of that portion of Peru
suffered such a change owing to the hot current that bathed the coast.
…—Señor Frederico Alfonso Pezet.</p>
<p>…the sea is full of wonders, the land even more so. First of all the
desert becomes a garden …. The soil is soaked by the heavy downpour,
and within a few weeks the whole country is covered by abundant
pasture. The natural increase of flocks is practically doubled and
cotton can be grown in places where in other years vegetation seems
impossible.—From Mr. S.M. Scott &amp; Mr. H. Twiddle quoted from a paper
by Murphy, 1926.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The El Niño of 1957 was even more exceptional. So much so that it
attracted the attention of meteorologists and oceanographers throughout
the Pacific basin.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>By the fall of 1957, the coral ring of Canton Island, in the memory of
man ever bleak and dry, was lush with the seedlings of countless
tropical trees and vines.</p>
<p>Figure 14.6 Correlation</p>
<p>coefficient of annual-mean sea-level pressure with pressure at Darwin.

<p><span id="fig:ensocorrelations" label="fig:ensocorrelations"></span></p>
<p>One is inclined to select the events of this isolated atoll as
epitomizing the year, for even here, on the remote edges of the
Pacific, vast concerted shifts in the ocean and atmosphere had wrought
dramatic change.</p>
<p>Elsewhere about the Pacific it also was common knowledge that the year
had been one of extraordinary climatic events. Hawaii had its first
recorded typhoon; the seabird-killing <em>El Niño</em> visited the Peruvian
coast; the ice went out of Point Barrow at the earliest time in
history; and on the Pacific’s western rim, the tropical rainy season
lingered six weeks beyond its appointed term—Sette and Isaacs
(1960).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Just months after the event, in 1958, a distinguished group of
oceanographers and meteorologists assembled in Rancho Santa Fe,
California to try to understand the <em>Changing Pacific Ocean in 1957 and
1958</em> (Sette and Isaacs (1960). There, for perhaps the first time, they
began the synthesis of atmospheric and oceanic events leading to our
present understanding of El Niño.</p>
<p>While oceanographers had been mostly concerned with the eastern
equatorial Pacific and El Niño, meteorologists had been mostly concerned
with the western tropical Pacific, the tropical Indian Ocean, and the
Southern Oscillation. Hildebrandsson, the Lockyers, and Sir Gilbert
Walker noticed in the early decades of the 20th century that pressure
fluctuations throughout that region are highly correlated with pressure
fluctuations in many other regions of the world (figure 14.6). Because
variations in pressure are associated with winds and rainfall, they
wanted to find out if pressure in one region could be used to forecast
weather in other regions using the correlations.</p>
<p>The early studies found that the two strongest centers of the
variability are near Darwin, Australia and Tahiti. The fluctuations at
Darwin are opposite those at Tahiti, and resemble an oscillation.
Furthermore, the two centers had strong correlations with pressure in
areas far from the Pacific. Walker named the fluctuations the <em>Southern
Oscillation</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Southern Oscillation Index</em> is sea-level pressure at Tahiti minus
sea-level pressure at Darwin (figure 14.7) normalized by the standard
deviation of the difference. The index is related to the trade winds.
When the index is high, the pressure gradient between east and west in
the tropical Pacific is large, and the trade winds are strong. When the
index is negative trades, are weak.</p>
<p>Figure 14.7 Normalized Southern Oscillation</p>
<p>Index from 1951 to 1999. The normalized index is sea-level pressure
anomaly at Tahiti divided by its standard deviation minus sea-level
pressure anomaly at Darwin divided by its standard deviation then the
difference is divided by the standard deviation of the difference. The
means are calculated from 1951 to 1980. Monthly values of the index have
been smoothed with a 5-month running mean. Strong El Niño events
occurred in 1957–58, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1982–83, 1997–98. Data from
<span class="smallcaps">noaa</span>. <span id="fig:soi" label="fig:soi"></span></p>
<p>The connection between the Southern Oscillation and El Niño was made
soon after the Rancho Santa Fe meeting. Ichiye and Petersen (1963) and
Bjerknes (1966) noticed the relationship between equatorial temperatures
in the Pacific during the 1957 El Niño and fluctuations in the trade
winds associated with the Southern Oscillation. The theory was further
developed by Wyrtki (1975).</p>
<p>Because El Niño and the Southern Oscillation are so closely related, the
phenomenon is often referred to as the <em>El Niño–Southern Oscillation</em>
or <span class="smallcaps">enso</span>. More recently, the oscillation is referred to as
El Niño/La Niña, where La Niña refers to the positive phase of the
oscillation when trade winds are strong, and water temperature in the
eastern equatorial region is very cold.</p>
</section>
<section id="definition-of-el-nino">
<h3><span class="section-number">14.2.2. </span>Definition of El Niño<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-el-nino" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Philander (1990) points out that each El Niño is unique, with different
temperature, pressure, and rainfall patterns. Some are strong, some are
weak. So, exactly what events deserve to be called El Niño? The
<span class="smallcaps">icoads</span> data show that the best indicator of El Niño is
sea-level pressure anomaly in the eastern equatorial Pacific from 4S to
4N and from 108W to 98W (Harrison and Larkin, 1996). It correlates
better with sea-surface temperature in the central Pacific than with the
Southern-Oscillation Index. Thus the importance of the El Niño is not
exactly proportional to the Southern Oscillation Index—the strong El
Niño of 1957–58, has a weaker signal in figure 14.7 than the weaker El
Niño of 1965–66.</p>
<p>Trenberth (1997) recommends that those disruptions of the equatorial
system in the Pacific shall be called an El Niño only when the 5-month
running mean of sea-surface temperature anomalies in the region 5N–5S,
120W–170W exceeds 0.4C for six months or longer.</p>
<p>So El Niño, which started life as a change in currents off Peru each
Christmas, has grown into a giant. It now means a disruption of the
ocean-atmosphere system over the whole equatorial Pacific.</p>
</section>
<section id="theory-of-el-nino">
<h3><span class="section-number">14.2.3. </span>Theory of El Niño<a class="headerlink" href="#theory-of-el-nino" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Wyrtki (1975) gives a clear description of El Niño.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the two years preceding El Niño, excessively strong southeast
trades are present in the central Pacific. These strong southeast
trades intensify the subtropical gyre of the South Pacific, strengthen
the South Equatorial Current, and increase the east-west slope of sea
level by building up water in the western equatorial Pacific. As soon
as the wind stress in the central Pacific relaxes, the accumulated
water flows eastward, probably in the form of an equatorial Kelvin
wave. This wave leads to the accumulation of warm water off Ecuador
and Peru and to a depression of the usually shallow thermocline. In
total, El Niño is the result of the response of the equatorial Pacific
to atmospheric forcing by the trade winds.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the trades in the western equatorial Pacific not only weaken,
they actually reverse direction for a few weeks to a month, producing
<em>westerly wind bursts</em> that quickly deepen the thermocline there. The
deepening of the thermocline launches an eastward propagating Kelvin
wave and a westward propagating Rossby wave. (If you are asking, What
are Kelvin and Rossby waves? I will answer that in a minute. So please
be patient.)</p>
<p>Figure 14.8 Anomalies</p>
<p>of sea-surface temperature (in C) during a typical El Niño obtained by
averaging data from El Niños between 1950 and 1973. Months are after the
onset of the event. After Rasmusson and Carpenter (1982).
<span id="fig:elninoanomalies" label="fig:elninoanomalies"></span></p>
<p>The Kelvin wave deepens the thermocline as it moves eastward, and it
carries warm water eastward. Both processes cause a deepening of the
mixed layer in the eastern equatorial Pacific a few months after the
wave is launched in the western Pacific. The deeper thermocline in the
east leads to upwelling of warm water, and the surface temperatures
offshore of Ecuador and Peru warms by 2–4. The warm water reduces the
temperature contrast between east and west, further reducing the trades.
The strong positive feedback between sea-surface temperature and the
trade winds causes rapid development of El Niño.</p>
<p>With time, the warm pool spreads east, eventually extending as far as
140W (figure 14.8). Plus, water warms in the east along the equator due
to upwelling of warm water, and to reduced advection of cold water from
the east due to weaker trade winds.</p>
<p>The warm waters along the equator in the east cause the areas of heavy
rain to move eastward from Melanesia and Fiji to the central Pacific.
Essentially, a major source of heat for the atmospheric circulation
moves from the west to the central Pacific, and the whole atmosphere
responds to the change. Bjerknes (1972), describing the interaction
between the ocean and the atmosphere over the eastern equatorial Pacific
concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the cold ocean case (1964) the atmosphere has a pronounced stable
layer between 900 and 800 mb, preventing convection and rainfall, and
in the warm case (1965) the heat supply from the ocean eliminates the
atmospheric stability and activates rainfall. …A side effect of the
widespread warming of the tropical belt of the atmosphere shows up in
the increase of exchange of angular momentum with the neighboring
subtropical belt, whereby the subtropical westerly jet strengthens
…The variability of the heat and moisture supply to the global
atmospheric thermal engine from the equatorial Pacific can be shown to
have far-reaching large-scale effects.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Klaus Wyrtki (1985), drawing on extensive observations of El Niño,
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A complete El Niño cycle results in a net heat discharge from the
tropical Pacific toward higher latitudes. At the end of the cycle the
tropical Pacific is depleted of heat, which can only be restored by
the slow accumulation of warm water in the western Pacific by the
normal trade winds. Consequently, the time scale of the Southern
Oscillation is given by the time required for the accumulation of warm
water in the western Pacific.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It is these far reaching events that make El Niño so important. Few
people care about warm water off Peru around Christmas, many care about
global changes the weather. El Niño is important because of its
atmospheric influence.</p>
<p>When the Kelvin wave reaches the coast of Ecuador, part is reflected as
an westward propagating Rossby wave, and part propagates north and south
as a coastal trapped Kelvin wave carrying warm water to higher
latitudes. For example, during the 1957 El Niño, the northward
propagating Kelvin wave produced unusually warm water off shore of
California, and it eventually reached Alaska. This warming of the west
coast of North America further influences climate in North America,
especially in California.</p>
<p>As the Kelvin wave moves along the coast, it forces Rossby waves which
move west across the Pacific at a velocity that depends on the latitude
(14.4). The velocity is very slow at high latitudes and fastest on the
equator, where the reflected wave moves back as a deepening of the
thermocline, reaching the central equatorial Pacific a year later.
Similarly, the westward propagating Rossby wave launched at the start of
the El Niño in the west, reflects off Asia and returns to the central
equatorial Pacific as a Kelvin wave, again about a year later.</p>
<p>El Niño ends when the Rossby waves reflected from Asia and Ecuador meet
in the central Pacific about a year after the onset of El Niño (Picaut,
Masia, and du Penhoat, 1997). The waves push the warm pool at the
surface toward the west. At the same time, the Rossby wave reflected
from the western boundary causes the thermocline in the central Pacific
to become shallower when the waves reaches the central Pacific. Then any
strengthening of the trades causes upwelling of cold water in the east,
which increases the east-west temperature gradient, which increases the
trades, which increases the upwelling (Takayabu et al 1999). The system
is then thrown into the La Niña state with strong trades, and a very
cold tongue along the equator in the east.</p>
<p>La Niña tends to last longer than El Niño, and the cycle from La Niña to
El Niño and back takes about three years. The cycle isn’t exact. El Niño
comes back at intervals from 2-7 years, with an average near four years
(figure 14.7).</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">14.2.4. </span>Equatorial Kelvin and Rossby Waves<a class="headerlink" href="#equatorial-kelvin-and-rossby-waves" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Kelvin and Rossby waves are the ocean’s way of adjusting to changes in
forcing such as westerly wind bursts. The adjustment occurs as waves of
current and sea level that are influenced by gravity, Coriolis force
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>, and the north-south variation of Coriolis force
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial f/\partial y = \beta\)</span>. There are many kinds of these waves
with different frequencies, wavelengths, and velocities. If gravity and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> are the restoring forces, the waves are called Kelvin and Poincaré
waves. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> is the restoring force, the waves are called planetary
waves. One important type of planetary wave is the Rossby wave.</p>
<p>Two types of waves are especially important for El Niño: internal Kelvin
waves and Rossby waves. Both waves can have modes that are confined to a
narrow, north-south region centered on the equator. These are
<em>equatorially trapped waves</em>. Both exist in slightly different forms at
higher latitudes.</p>
<p>Kelvin and Rossby wave theory is beyond the scope of this book, so I
will just tell you what they are without deriving the properties of the
waves. If you are curious, you can find the details in Philander (1990):
Chapter 3; Pedlosky (1987): Chapter 3; and Apel (1987): §6.10–6.12. If
you know little about waves, their wavelength, frequency, group and
phase velocities, skip to Chapter 16 and read §16.1.</p>
<p>The theory for equatorial waves is based on a two-layer model of the
ocean (figure 14.9). Because the tropical ocean have a thin, warm,
surface layer above a sharp thermocline, such a model is a good
approximation for those regions.</p>

speeds of up to 3 m/s, and they cross the Pacific in a few months.
Currents associated with the wave are everywhere eastward with
north-south component (figure 14.10).</p>

After Philander et al. (1984: 120). <span id="fig:rossbycurrents" label="fig:rossbycurrents"></span></p>
<p>Kelvin waves can also propagate poleward as a trapped wave along an east
coast of an ocean basin. Their group velocity is also given by (14.3),
and they are confined to a coastal zone with width
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=c/\left(\beta\,y\right)\)</span></p>
<p>The important Rossby waves on the equator have frequencies much less
than the Coriolis frequency. They can travel only to the west. The group
velocity is:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{Rg} = - \frac{c}{\left(2\,n+1\right)}; \qquad n=1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\)</span>$
The fastest wave travels westward at a velocity near 0.8 m/s. The
currents associated with the wave are almost in geostrophic balance in
two counter-rotating eddies centered on the equator (figure 14.10).</p>
<p>Away from the equator, low-frequency, long-wavelength Rossby waves also
travel only to the west, and the currents associated with the waves are
again almost in geostrophic balance. Group velocity depends strongly on
latitude: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{Rg} = -\frac{\beta\,g'\,H}{f^2}\)</span>$</p>
<p>Wave dynamics in the equatorial regions differ markedly from wave
dynamics at mid-latitudes. Baroclinic waves are much faster, and the
response of the ocean to changes in wind forcing is much faster than at
mid-latitudes. For planetary waves near the equator, we can speak of an
<em>equatorial wave guide</em>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s return to El Niño and its “far-reaching large-scale effects.”</p>

<p><em>Teleconnections</em> are statistically significant correlations between
weather events that occur at different places on the earth. Figure 14.11
shows the dominant global teleconnections associated with the El
Niño/Southern Oscillation.</p>

<span id="fig:teleconnections" label="fig:teleconnections"></span></p>
<p>The influence of <span class="smallcaps">enso</span> is through its influence on
convection and associated latent heat release in the equatorial Pacific.
As the area of heavy rain moves east, the source of atmospheric heating
moves with the rain, leading to widespread changes in atmospheric
circulation and weather patterns outside the tropical Pacific (McPhaden,
Zebiak and Glantz, 2006), including perturbations in atmospheric
pressure (figure 14.12). This sequence of events leads to some
predictability of weather patterns a season in advance over North
America, Brazil, Australia, South Africa and other regions.</p>
<p>The <span class="smallcaps">enso</span> perturbations to mid-latitude and tropical
weather systems leads to dramatic changes in rainfall in some regions
(figure 14.11). As the convective regions migrate east along the
equator, they bring rain to the normally arid, central-Pacific islands.
The lack of rain the western Pacific leads to drought in Indonesia and
Australia.</p>

<p>Figure 14.11 shows a global view of teleconnections. Let’s zoom in to
one region, Texas, that I chose only because I live there. The global
figure shows that the region should have higher than normal rainfall in
the winter season after El Niño begins. I therefore correlated yearly
averaged rainfall for the state of Texas to the Southern Oscillation
Index (figure 14.13). Wet years correspond to El Niño years in the
equatorial Pacific. During El Niño, convection normally found in the
western equatorial Pacific moved east into the central equatorial
Pacific. The subtropical jet also moves east, carrying tropical moisture
across Mexico to Texas and the Mississippi Valley. Cold fronts in winter
interact with the upper level moisture to produce abundant winter rains
from Texas eastward.</p>

<p>The tropical and equatorial Pacific is a vast, remote area seldom
visited by ships. To observe the region <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span>’s Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle deployed an array of buoys to
measure oceanographic and meteorological variables (figure 14.14). The
first buoy was successfully deployed in 1976 by David Halpern. Since
then, new moorings have been added to the array, new instruments have
been added to the moorings, and the moorings have been improved. The
program has now evolved into the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean
<span class="smallcaps">tao</span> array of approximately 70 deep-ocean moorings spanning
the equatorial Pacific Ocean between 8N and 8S from 95W to 137E
(McPhaden et al, 1998).</p>
<p>The array began full operation in December 1994, and it continues to
evolve. The work necessary to design and calibrate instruments, deploy
moorings, and process data is coordinated through the <span class="smallcaps">tao</span>
Project. It is a multi-national effort involving the United States,
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and France with a project office at the Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory.</p>
<p>The <span class="smallcaps">tao</span> moorings measure air temperature, relative
humidity, surface wind velocity, sea-surface temperatures, and
subsurface temperatures from 10 meters down to 500 meters. Five moorings
located on the equator at 110W, 140W, 170W, 165E, and 147E also carry
upward-looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers <span class="smallcaps">adcp</span> to
measure upper-ocean currents between 10 m and 250 m. Data are sent back
through the Argos system, and data are processed and made available in
near real time. The moorings are recovered and replaced yearly. All
sensors are calibrated prior to deployment and after recovery.</p>

<p>Data from <span class="smallcaps">tao</span> are merged with altimeter data from Jasin,

they could be used to produce accurate maps of sea level every ten days.
The maps provided detailed views of the development of the 1997–1998 El
Niño in near real time that were widely reproduced throughout the world.
The observations (figure 10.6) show high sea level propagating from west
to east, peaking in the eastern equatorial Pacific in November 1997. In
addition, satellite data extended beyond the <span class="smallcaps">tao</span> data

oceanographers to look for extra-tropical influences on El Niño.</p>
<p>Rain rates are measured by <span class="smallcaps">nasa</span>’s Tropical Rainfall

visible and infrared scanner, a cloud and earth radiant energy system,
and a lightning imaging sensor. Working together, the instruments
provide data necessary to produce monthly maps of tropical rainfall
averaged over 500 km by 500 km areas with 15% accuracy. The grid is
global between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm\)</span><!-- -->35 latitude. In addition, the

<h2><span class="section-number">14.5. </span>Forecasting El Niño<a class="headerlink" href="#forecasting-el-nino" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The importance of El Niño to global weather patterns has led to many
schemes for forecasting events in the equatorial Pacific. Several
generations of models have been produced, but the skill of the forecasts
has not always increased. Models worked well for a few years, then
failed. Failure was followed by improved models, and the cycle
continued. Thus, the best models in 1991 failed to predict weak El Niños
in 1993 and 1994 (Ji, Leetmaa, and Kousky, 1996). The best model of the
mid 1990s failed to predict the onset of the strong El Niño of 1997-1998
although a new model developed by the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction made the best forecast of the development of the event. In
general, the more sophisticated the model, the better the forecasts
(Kerr, 1998).</p>
<p>The following recounts some of the more recent work to improve the
forecasts. For simplicity, I describe the technique used by the National
Centers for Environmental Prediction (Ji, Behringer, and Leetmaa, 1998).
But Chen et al. (1995), Latif et al. (1993), and Barnett et al. (1993),
among others, have all developed useful prediction models.</p>
<p><strong>Atmospheric Models</strong> How well can we model atmospheric processes over
the Pacific? To help answer the question, the World Climate Research
Program’s Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (Gates, 1992)
compared output from 30 different atmospheric numerical models for 1979
to 1988. <em>The Variability in the Tropics: Synoptic to Intraseasonal
Timescales</em> subproject is especially important because it documents the
ability of 15 atmospheric general-circulation models to simulate the
observed variability in the tropical atmosphere (Slingo et al. 1995).
The models included several operated by government weather forecasting
centers, including the model used for day-to-day forecasts by the
European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p>
<p>The first results indicate that none of the models were able to
duplicate all important interseasonal variability of the tropical
atmosphere on timescales of 2 to 80 days. Models with weak intraseasonal
activity tended to have a weak annual cycle. Most models seemed to
simulate some important aspects of the interannual variability including
El Niño. The length of the time series was, however, too short to
provide conclusive results on interannual variability.</p>
<p>The results of the substudy imply that numerical models of the
atmospheric general circulation need to be improved if they are to be
used to study tropical variability and the response of the atmosphere to
changes in the tropical ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Oceanic Models</strong> Our ability to understand El Niño also depends on our
ability to model the oceanic circulation in the equatorial Pacific.
Because the models provide the initial conditions used for the
forecasts, they must be able to assimilate up-to-date measurements of
the Pacific along with heat fluxes and surface winds calculated from the
atmospheric models. The measurements include sea-surface winds from
scatterometers and moored buoys, surface temperature from the
optimal-interpolation data set (see §6.6), subsurface temperatures from
buoys and <span class="smallcaps">xbt</span>s, and sea level from altimetry and
tide-gauges on islands.</p>
<p>Ji, Behringer, and Leetmaa (1998) at the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction have modified the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory’s Modular Ocean Model for use in the tropical Pacific (see
§15.3 for more information about this model). It’s domain is the Pacific
between 45 and 55 and between 120 and 70. The zonal resolution is 1.5 .
The meridional resolution is 1/3 within 10 of the equator, increasing
smoothly to 1 poleward of 20 latitude. It has 28 vertical levels, with
18 in the upper 400 m to resolve the mixed layer and thermocline. The
model is driven by mean winds from Hellerman and Rosenstein (1983),
anomalies in the wind field from Florida State University, and mean heat
fluxes from Oberhuber (1988). It assimilates subsurface temperature from
the <span class="smallcaps">tao</span> array and <span class="smallcaps">xbt</span>s, and surface
temperatures from the monthly optimal-interpolation data set (Reynolds
and Smith, 1994).</p>
<p>The output of the model is an ocean analysis, the density and current
field that best fits the data used in the analysis (figures 14.3 and
14.4). This is used to drive a coupled ocean-atmosphere model to produce
forecasts.</p>
<p><strong>Coupled Models</strong> Coupled models are separate atmospheric and oceanic
models that pass information through their common boundary at the sea
surface, thus coupling the two calculations. The coupling can be one
way, from the atmosphere, or two way, into and out of the ocean. In the
scheme used by the <span class="smallcaps">noaa</span> National Centers for Environmental
Prediction the ocean model is the same Modular Ocean Model described
above. It is coupled to a low-resolution version of the global,
medium-range forecast model operated by the National Centers (Kumar,
Leetmaa, and Ji, 1994). Anomalies of wind stress, heat, and fresh-water
fluxes calculated from the atmospheric model are added to the mean
annual values of the fluxes, and the sums are used to drive the ocean
model. Sea-surface temperature calculated from the ocean model is used
to drive the atmospheric model from 15 to 15.</p>
<p>As computer power decreases in cost, models are becoming ever more
complex. The trend is to global coupled models able to include other
coupled ocean-atmosphere systems in addition to <span class="smallcaps">enso</span>. I
return to the problem in §15.6 where I describe global coupled models.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Models</strong> Statistical models are based on an analysis of
weather patterns in the Pacific using data going back many decades. The
basic idea is that if weather patterns today are similar to patterns at
some time in the past, then todays patterns will evolve as they did at
that past time. For example, if winds and temperatures in the tropical
Pacific today are similar to wind and temperatures just before the 1976
El Niño, then we might expect a similar El Niño to start in the near
future.</p>
<p><strong>Forecasts</strong> In general, the coupled ocean-atmosphere models produce
forecasts that are no better than the statistical forecasts (Jan van
Oldenborgh, 2005). The forecasts include not only events in the Pacific
but also the global consequences of El Niño. The forecasts are judged
two ways:</p>
<p>Using the correlation between the area-averaged sea-surface-temperature
anomalies from the model and the observed temperature anomalies in the
eastern equatorial Pacific. The area is usually from 170 to 120 between
5 and 5. Useful forecasts have correlations exceeding 0.6.</p>
<p>Using the root-mean-square difference between the observed and predicted
sea-surface temperature in the same area.</p>
<p>The forecasts of the very strong 1997 El Niño have been carefully
studied. Jan van Oldenborg et al (2005) and Barnston et al (1999) found
no models successfully forecast the earliest onset of the El Niño in
late 1996 and early 1997. The first formal announcements of the El Niño
were made in May 1997. Nor did any model forecast the large temperature
anomalies observed in the eastern equatorial Pacific until the area had
already warmed. There was no clear distinction between the accuracy of
the dynamical or statistical forecasts.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Equatorial processes are important because heat released by rain in
the equatorial region helps drives much of the atmospheric
circulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Solar energy absorbed by the Pacific is the most important driver of
atmospheric circulation. Solar energy is lost from the ocean mainly
by evaporation. The heat warms the atmosphere and drives the
circulation when the latent heat of evaporation is released in rainy
areas, primarily in the western tropical Pacific and the
Intertropical Convergence Zone.</p>
<p>The interannual variability of currents and temperatures in the
equatorial Pacific modulates the oceanic forcing of the atmosphere.
This interannual variability is associated with El Niño/La Niña.</p>
<p>Changes in equatorial dynamics cause changes in atmospheric
circulation by changing the location of rain in tropical Pacific and
therefore the location of the major heat source driving the
atmospheric circulation.</p>
<p>El Niño causes the biggest changes in equatorial dynamics. During El
Niño, trade-winds weaken in the western Pacific, the thermocline
becomes less deep in the west. This drives a Kelvin wave eastward
along the equator, which deepens the thermocline in the eastern
Pacific. The warm pool in the west moves eastward toward the central
Pacific, and the intense tropical rain areas move with the warm
pool.</p>
<p>El Ni[̃n]o is the largest source of year-to-year fluctuations in
global weather patterns.</p>
<p>As a result of El Niño, drought occurs in the Indonesian area and
northern Australia, and floods occur in western, tropical South
America. Variations in the atmospheric circulation influence more
distant areas through teleconnections.</p>
<p>Forecasts of El Niño are made using coupled ocean-atmospheric
numerical models. Forecasts appear to have useful accuracy for 3–6
months in advance, mostly after the onset of El Niño.</p>
